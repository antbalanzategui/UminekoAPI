Description: There must be no love interest. The business in hand is to bring a criminal to the bar of justice, not to bring a lovelorn couple to the hymeneal altar.
Type: Rules

ID: 4
Name: Van Dine's Fourth
Description: The detective himself, or one of the official investigators, should never turn out to be the culprit. This is bald trickery, on a par with offering someone a bright penny for a five-dollar gold piece. It is false pretenses.
Type: Rules

ID: 5
Name: Van Dine's Fifth
Description: The culprit must be determined by logical deductions — not by accident or coincidence or unmotivated confession. To solve a criminal problem in this latter fashion is like sending the reader on a deliberate wild-goose chase, and then telling him, after he has failed, that you had the object of his search up your sleeve all the time. Such an author is no better than a practical joker.
Type: Rules

ID: 6
Name: Van Dine's Sixth
Description: The detective novel must have a detective in it; and a detective is not a detective unless he detects. His function is to gather clues that will eventually lead to the person who did the dirty work in the first chapter; and if the detective does not reach his conclusions through an analysis of those clues, he has no more solved his problem than the schoolboy who gets his answer out of the back of the arithmetic.
Type: Rules

ID: 7
Name: Van Dine's Seventh
Description: There simply must be a corpse in a detective novel, and the deader the corpse, the better. No lesser crime than murder will suffice. Three hundred pages are far too much bother for a crime other than murder. After all, the reader's trouble and expenditure of energy must be rewarded.
Type: Rules

ID: 8
Name: Van Dine's Eighth
Description: The problem of the crime must be solved by strictly naturalistic means. Such methods for learning the truth as slate-writing, Ouija boards, mind-reading, spiritualistic séances, crystal-gazing, and the like, are taboo. A reader has a chance when matching his wits with a rationalistic detective, but if he must compete with the world of spirits and go chasing about the fourth dimension of metaphysics, he is defeated ab initio.
Type: Rules

ID: 9
Name: Van Dine's Ninth
Description: There must be but one detective — that is, but one protagonist of deduction — one deus ex machina. To bring the minds of three or four, or sometimes a gang of detectives to bear on a problem, is not only to disperse the interest and break the direct thread of logic but to take an unfair advantage of the reader. If there is more than one detective, the reader does not know who his coeducator is. It is like making the reader run a race with a relay team.
Type: Rules

ID: 10
Name: Van Dine's Tenth
Description: The culprit must turn out to be a person who has played a more or less prominent part in the story — that is, a person with whom the reader is familiar and in whom he takes an interest.
Type: Rules

ID: 11
Name: Van Dine's Eleventh
Description: A servant must not be chosen by the author as the culprit. This is begging a noble question. It is a too easy solution. The culprit must be a decidedly worth-while person — one that wouldn't ordinarily come under suspicion.
Type: Rules

ID: 12
Name: Van Dine's Twelfth
Description: There must be but one culprit, no matter how many murders are committed. The culprit may, of course, have a minor helper or co-plotter, but the entire onus must rest on one pair of shoulders: the entire indignation of the reader must be permitted to concentrate on a single black nature.
Type: Rules

ID: 13
Name: Van Dine's Thirteenth
Description: Secret societies, camorras, mafias, et al., have no place in a detective story. A fascinating and truly beautiful murder is irremediably spoiled by any such wholesale culpability. To be sure, the murderer in a detective novel should be given a sporting chance, but it is going too far to grant him a secret society to fall back on. No high-class, self-respecting murderer would want such odds.
Type: Rules

ID: 14
Name: Van Dine's Fourteenth
Description: The method of murder, and the means of detecting it, must be rational and scientific. That is to say, pseudo-science and purely imaginative and speculative devices are not to be tolerated in the roman policier. Once an author soars into the realm of fantasy, in the Jules Verne manner, he is outside the bounds of detective fiction, cavorting in the uncharted reaches of adventure.
Type: Rules

ID: 15
Name: Van Dine's Fifteenth
Description: The truth of the problem must at all times be apparent — provided the reader is shrewd enough to see it. By this, I mean that if the reader, after learning the explanation for the crime, should reread the book, he would see that the solution had, in a sense, been staring him in the face — that all the clues really pointed to the culprit — and that, if he had been as clever as the detective, he could have solved the mystery himself without going on to the final chapter. That the clever reader does often thus solve the problem goes without saying.
Type: Rules

ID: 16
Name: Van Dine's Sixteenth
Description: A detective novel should contain no long descriptive passages, no literary dallying with side-issues, no subtly worked-out character analyses, no "atmospheric" preoccupations. Such matters have no vital place in a record of crime and deduction. They hold up the action and introduce issues irrelevant to the main purpose, which is to state a problem, analyze it, and bring it to a successful conclusion. To be sure, there must be sufficient descriptiveness and character delineation to give the novel verisimilitude.
Type: Rules

ID: 17
Name: Van Dine's Seventeenth
Description: A professional criminal must never be shouldered with the guilt of a crime in a detective story. Crimes by housebreakers and bandits are the province of the police departments — not of authors and brilliant amateur detectives. A really fascinating crime is one committed by a pillar of a church or a spinster noted for her charities.
Type: Rules

ID: 18
Name: Van Dine's Eighteenth
Description: A crime in a detective story must never turn out to be an accident or a suicide. To end an odyssey of sleuthing with such an anti-climax is to hoodwink the trusting and kind-hearted reader.
Type: Rules

ID: 19
Name: Van Dine's Nineteenth
Description: The motives for all crimes in detective stories should be personal. International plotting and war politics belong in a different category of fiction — in secret-service tales, for instance. But a murder story must be kept gemütlich, so to speak. It must reflect the reader's everyday experiences and give him a certain outlet for his own repressed desires and emotions.

Name: Van Dine's Twentieth
Description: And (to give my Credo an even score of items) I herewith list a few of the devices that no self-respecting detective story writer will now avail himself of. They have been employed too often and are familiar to all true lovers of literary crime. To use them is a confession of the author's ineptitude and lack of originality.
Determining the identity of the culprit by comparing the butt of a cigarette left at the scene of the crime with the brand smoked by a suspect.
The bogus spiritualistic séance to frighten the culprit into giving himself away.
Forged fingerprints.
The dummy-figure alibi.
The dog that does not bark and thereby reveals the fact that the intruder is familiar.
The final pinning of the crime on a twin or a relative who looks exactly like the suspected but innocent person.
The hypodermic syringe and the knockout drops.
The commission of the murder in a locked room after the police have actually broken in.
The word association test for guilt.
The cipher or code letter, which is eventually unraveled by the sleuth.

ID: 33
Name: Detective's Authority
Description: A genre convention stating that the detective must not be hindered in the discovery of any clues necessary to a solution. The detective's inspection must be allowed to be so thorough that it obviates any Devil's Proof. The concept of Detective's Authority is never explained to Battler Ushiromiya, so Battler never properly makes use of it until he sees Erika Furudo use Detective's Authority once she takes over as detective. The existence of Detective's Authority is in compliance with Knox's Seventh and Van Dine's First.

Name: Devil's Proof
Description: A logical dilemma stating that, though evidence will disprove the existence of something, lack of evidence will not disprove it. Put simply, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The phrase "Devil's Proof" is often used as shorthand for Battler Ushiromiya's style of fighting.

Name: Game
Description: Supernatural beings in Umineko no Naku Koro ni play "games" using certain setpieces as the game boards. The game is often paralleled with chess and consists of two opposing sides attempting to solve a murder mystery. One side, the Witch Side, attempts to prove that the murders could only be committed by witches. The other side, the Human Side, instead attempts to prove that it is possible for a human culprit to commit the murders and effectively deny the existence of magic within the game board.

Name: Hempel's Raven
Description: A logical dilemma illustrating a logical contradiction in the definition of "evidence." The titular example for the dilemma is that, in order to prove all ravens are black, one may observe either a black raven or a non-black non-raven, and both constitute as evidence (By this logic, a black raven and a red apple are both evidence that all ravens are black). Typically used as a counter to the Devil's Proof.

ID: 44
Name: Logic Error
Description: A logic error occurs when there is a contradiction in the tale created by the Game Master. After the discovery of a Logic Error, the Game Master can choose to either shamefully admit their mistake or attempt to fix it. If the Game Master admits the mistake, then the game is destroyed. If the Game Master tries to fix the game, then they will be submitted to an eternity of trying to fix the Logic Error. Due to the complex nature of these errors, this is viewed as a type of torture.

ID: 49
Name: Turning the board around
Description: A phrase often repeated by Kyrie and Battler Ushiromiya. The concept of turning the board around is based in chess. Essentially, the phrase means to consider the situation from the opponent's perspective. The flaw in the phrase comes from the core difference between chess and the games of Umineko no Naku Koro ni. In chess, both sides have the same goal (capturing the opposing king), but in the games of Umineko no Naku Koro ni, the Witch Side and Human Side have different goals. As such, without a true understanding of the opponent's motives, nothing can be gained from "turning the board around."
