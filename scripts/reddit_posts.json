The cast is so damn memorable and well written.    \nBest moments for me would be confession of the golden witch and the drowning scene.    \n\nMade a post about my theory after ep 4 and it turned out right lol, was really happy.   \n\nSomethings which still haven't resolved in me are follows though:    \n- how is someone supposed to understand the whydunnit by just ep 1-4? Yet will said he figured it out by then, i just can't see enough hints to make that conclusion from ep 1-4 only even now.   \n- please clear me on this, battler in the drowning scene is the real one, but i don't see why he would throw his life for shannon, according to the manga, he noticed that beato is shannon yet he jumped for a girl he hasn't seen in 6 years? He threw away his life for that girl to whom he had a crush on at the age of 12 even though his sister was waiting for him? \nIf we go by the vn, it appears both are the battler and beato which we followed in the story, then it would make sense because he really really loves her. \nBut according to the manga, that beato is just her childhood crush to whom he didn't talk to from ages.    \n\n\nAs for the ep ranking:    \n8&gt;7&gt;6&gt;4&gt;5&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1   \nEp 2 felt much much better once i completed it lol.    \nTier list is also attached, i just can't put beato shannon and kanon is separate tiers man, it kinda breaks my heart.",

Opponents can refute it with counterarguments (2bar) to prevent the super. The instigator can then counter proclaim (2bar), succeeding metaworld with reduced metaworld duration. This can occur one more time back and forth\n\nBasically every character has 1x proclamation, 2x sequential counter proclamation and 2x sequential counter arguments. Would love to see a video showcasing these for every character, using char specific pairings (eg battler v beato, shannon v George, Kanon v jessica etc).\n\nAnyone come across anything like this?

That's what my first love was like, ihihi.\"\n\nUnless I have missed something, Battler is more than likely talking about his relationship with Sayo here. Either way, it's also a perfect description of the relationship Jessica had with Yoshiya.\n\nOther thing that made me think this is the second twilight of the second game. Yoshiya doesn't read the room correctly, and ends up making a comment that's meant to be nice but ends up destroying Jessica's hopes and dreams. Which is a very similar situation to the one Sayo had with Battler and his false promise. \n\nBeatrice herself later shows up to tell Yoshiya exactly that, and she finds the sin so bad to the point it motivates her to kill Yoshiya and Jessica. The entire twilight was probably a hint directed towards Battler, but because of how Beatrice's game works it's also something Yoshiya would have done in character.\n\nBesides being a cool parallel, it does make me wonder what does this mean from Sayo's perspective. Yoshiya's shy and reserved attitude on the relationship is mostly blamed on his furniture complex, but now that we know he already experienced such a similar relationship while being on Jessica's position, it does make me wonder if he was aware of the irony of the entire situation.\n\nWas it on purpose? Was it on accident? Was it subconscious? Can't really think of any concrete theory at the moment. What do you guys think?",

I just wanted to check in on everyone's solutions for the Seventh Twilight in Bern's game.  \n  \nI almost managed to solve the entire thing; however, I stumbled at the end and was left with two possible solutions, Battler or George. This was a pretty annoying rut as both had points against them. The main reason   I went with George was because of his purple statement:  \n  \n**\"no one could kill Doctor Nanjo inside the guesthouse\"**  \n  \ndirectly went against the narrative that states:  \n  \n**\"He [Doctor Nanjo] was killed in the entrance hall of the guesthouse\"**.  \n  \nOf course, this would go against Maria's purple, stating that George could only kill \"kids\"; there were no scenarios were both he and Maria could be culprits (so I had to assume that somehow Kanon was a separate person in this game, which was frustrating).  \n  \nIs there an actual solution to this that I am missing? Or is it possible that there is some mistranslation somewhere?",

I've been hearing it's UmiPro's, but I want to be sure for my first time.

        "selftext":"Ok. I finished Higurashi some time in the November of last month and now I\u2019m here to say I\u2019ve started my journey through the oh so infamous Umineko when they cry (the first VN I\u2019ve heard of actually but have since played House in Fata Morgana and Higurashi) so the hype to finally get on this was real. \nSo what did I just read? Ok so it makes sense.. like too much sense? It feels too easy is what I want to say I suppose. Everything feels very out and open, and I know for a fact it\u2019s even longer than Higurashi so clearly there\u2019s a lot idk yet but this opening question chapter was just too simple. I\u2019m waiting for the fucked up bit; the \u2018wtf are you on about and wtf is going on Ryukishi07???\u2019 You know? We did get a lot of them but it was the supplements. Like the Tea with everyone slowly dying and Beatrice\u2019s voice and design being revealed just like that and the way it blends actual story content with the meta is just confusing. I\u2019m forced to ask if this is the Land of Gold somehow or like an idea of what happened in the land of gold. Not to mention Bernkastel randomly appearing and looking like Rika?? I thought she was an adult?? Then there\u2019s the reveal of what Beatrice can do Kill anything without fail even though without fail is impossible and we learn the stakes of the seven deadly sins don\u2019t work on the pure (Maria? Natsuhi?) and those with magical resistance (Battler). \n\nAnyways onto the actual story itself: I liked it. A man hopelessly in love with a witch and everyone around him dragged into this game of her resurrection but there\u2019s one person who is basically an anathema that insists on not believing the simple fact that witches can exists and so repeatedly ruins everything? (That\u2019s the impression I got after reading the tea supplement chapter and in his character info if you choose execute- someone implies the same too probably Maria how? Idk yet but we\u2019ll see). A woman constantly shunned by everyone but ends up being the low-key hero of the story. Her useless husband who\u2019s smart but not lucky? And then his sister who\u2019s full of venom and very very fun\ud83d\udc80 I love Eva man. Every time she spoke I was so proud it felt like Miyo was had jump ship. Queen. I love that voice. Her husband who\u2019s always smiling and bringing levity. I love that they love each other. A younger brother who\u2019s into women too much and his surprisingly likeable new wife. You\u2019d think most wouldn\u2019t like her but she\u2019s actually likeable. Rosa a mother who can\u2019t bring herself to love her kid? Or a mother who feels her kid is too much of burden but decided to bear it anyway? \nI liked the adults actually all of em. Natsuhi and Eva are my favourite Ofc. \nShannon was just mid. Kanon was also just mid. Genji was cool in his loyalty and Nanjo felt like the kinda friend you wanted your grandfather to have bc he\u2019ll save you from many a beating. Chiyo going \u201chiiiii\u201d is my favourite thing, it\u2019s so funny but she\u2019s fun. Gohda is the worst my theory is after Maria was told to take care of the rose he went ahead and removed it. He\u2019s the perfectionist type who loves praise after all. So happy he died lol. \n\nBattler, he was fun. I liked him but he thinks too much and doesn\u2019t arrive at conclusions quick enough. His name is too poignant\ud83d\udc80 \nGeorge, ngl I expected him to be more but alas he was a kind older brother so we like him\nJessica, understood her plight and thought process but she always came off as the dumbest tbh\nMaria, WITCH, on protection duty. I need her wish granted to be a wish she\u2019s the one I\u2019m most compelled for emotionally so when they were asked to go to the parkour after the letter fiasco I was on my knees until Battler gave her the charm, which yes means I completely believe witches are real.\n\nI know the main conflict is supposed to be between Battler and Beatrice but I think it\u2019s low-key Battler and Maria. They are the most diametrically opposed in ideation. She\u2019s a believer to a fault and he\u2019s a logical to a fault. I\u2019d also like to add I hope this doesn\u2019t turn into a Battler x Beatrice story. I\u2019m all for romance but I like my witches being alien\u2014 mentally speaking\u2014af. Looks like she\u2019s having fun though so good for her. One of the big themes\u2014 if not the biggest- in Higurashi is believing in miracles it\u2019s an interesting to choice to have your m reject it completely. \n\nMy questions:\nHow did Beatrice die? Why? Also Maria doesn\u2019t forget things easily does she? Why did Natsuhi not admit the existence DPD the gold? That would\u2019ve made them more inclined to solve the epitaph\u2014 I\u2019ve no idea how to solve it besides thinking the home is on Rokkenjima somehow\u2014\nI\u2019ve also no idea where the story is going to go next: timeline reset? If so will they remember??? Or?? \n\n\nTLDR;\nI said a lot and there\u2019s a lot more I want to say but as usual I always end up just dumping my thoughts instead of actually reviewing anything. I hope you liked my tentative naivety. Anyways I liked this first question arc see in the next one.",

        "selftext":"I read episodes 1 and 2 on December 2021. I absolutely loved them and wanted to continue the story as soon as possible, however I made the conscious choice of stopping, as I wanted to be in the right headspace for such a long game. This April I decided to go back to it and found myself enthralled all over again. After finishing Episode 3 I decided to come here in order to see what people thought about the story so far. I did not expect to see people analyzing and coming up with theories about the twilights, at this point I did not even realize I was supposed to \"solve\" anything. I just kept reading and having a great time, enjoying the story. After seeing all the discussions, however, I decided to try and solve the mysteries, take notes, and pay close attention to the story. Now I have finished Episode 4 and have no actual working theory about the bigger picture. \n\nI was thinking about reading the manga of the first 4 episodes and analyzing the twilights there, as I've heard it is quite good and shorter compared to the vn. The thing I'm sorta worried about is missing crucial details and not reaching an answer before Episode 7, which I've read is the \"cut-off\" point for any working theories. \n\nI know I have to pay close attention to red truths, but I have a hard time deciding which ones are crucial to solving the bigger mystery. I also know I should be trying to solve the mystery about Beatrice, although I'm not exactly sure where to begin with that. My only guess is that she is someone who was deeply hurt by Kinzo(or someone from the Ushiromiya family and is now enacting her revenge on them). There is also Lambda and Bern, those two are wild cards to me as they seem to exist in a different plane of reality to even all the other witches. They also seem to have a vendetta against Beatrice. Locking onto a single culprit also seems like a difficult task. I honestly forgot most of the details about the twilights from the first two Episodes(which is part of the reason I thought reading the manga would be helpful) so I do not feel confident in labelling anyone as the culprit in those two games. For Episode 3 I believe Eva is responsible for some of the murders, the only question there would be who was responsible for Nanjo's murder. For Episode 4 it seems like whoever was disguised as Kinzo was the culprit. \n\nMy main question is \"How should I approach the mystery at this point?\"\n\n I love this game and would like to experience it in the \"proper\" way. I have not read any detective stories(closest thing would be ace attorney or danganronpa) so I am not super familiar with all the tropes this story plays with. I would really appreciate some guidance as I have never tried to solve any  mystery story such as this one. I am mostly a passive reader who lets things flow and sometimes comes up with a theory or two, however , I feel Umineko is a special kinda story that could be further enjoyed if I engage with its mystery. \n\nI'm sure there's no need to say this but no spoilers for anything past Episode 4 please.",

Indeed, the vast majority of our impressions of Kinzo come from the less-than-objective perspective of his children, so to imagine this isn't necessarily so hard. \n\nDid this influence your view of Kinzo after learning of his vile abuse in episode 7? Should Ange reject the truth of Kinzo the abuser and accept the truth of Kinzo the loving grandparent for her own peace of mind? Is it possible to accept both? Is it right to even consider extending sympathy\/love for someone who committed such a heinous act? I myself live with the reality of having a grandfather who both has a fairly monstrous past and was a sweet, generous grandfather to me.

I don't know if there's even an answer to this question but would love to hear your perspectives.\n\nEdit: to avoid coming off like a Kinzo apologist i'll add that i think Kinzo is a vile irredeemable monster who got off incredibly easily. I think we as readers are expected to fully condemn him, the story extends him some sympathy and acknowledges his guilt and grief but of course that doesn't remotely change anything he did. I also think the expectation for Ange may be slightly different and am curious as to your thoughts on that.",

        "selftext":"Have you ever been listening to a song from the soundtrack and wondered \"hmm.. what scene did this play during?\" No? Just me? Well I (and ChatGPT) wrote a Python script which searches through the lparchive playthroughs to find every time a song occurs throughout the games.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Download the ZIP for the project. It contains 3 files: the script, the database for episodes 1-4, and the database for episodes 5-8. All files must be present in the directory for the script to work:  [https:\/\/files.catbox.moe\/xc4b7f.zip](https:\/\/files.catbox.moe\/xc4b7f.zip)\n2. Extract the ZIP to your desired directory.\n3. Install Python if you haven't already.\n4. With your terminal set to the proper directory, run the command \"python [search.py](https:\/\/search.py) &lt;song&gt;\" where &lt;song&gt; is the string you want it to search for.\n\nNotes:\n\n* This script uses the \"pandas\" and \"sys\" modules. If needed, you can install them with \"pip install pandas\" and \"pip install sys\"\n* The script matches all songs which match the string. Ex. if you use the string \"red\" it will show you results for both \"Fake Red Shoes\" and \"Red Dread\". Here's some example output: [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/heXjc66.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/heXjc66.png)\n* This uses data found from these lparchive pages: [https:\/\/lparchive.org\/Umineko-no-Naku-Koro-ni\/](https:\/\/lparchive.org\/Umineko-no-Naku-Koro-ni\/) [https:\/\/lparchive.org\/Umineko-no-Naku-Koro-ni-Chiru\/](https:\/\/lparchive.org\/Umineko-no-Naku-Koro-ni-Chiru\/). Because of this, you should note that some songs may have typos at times, all songs played may or may not be present, and videos may occasionally show in the output as well (see the example output above). The good thing about this, though, is that the script shows you exactly what scene the song played during, and you can reread it on the lparchive page.\n* Feel free to re-host and share the files anywhere you want. I just used [catbox.moe](https:\/\/catbox.moe) because it was quick.\n* If anyone wants to adapt this code to a different language or create a GUI for it, they have my full permission. I only really made this as a personal project, but figured I'd share it in case anyone else finds it useful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm super stoked about the results, so I hope you'll find the time to give it a go! The second episode is on the horizon, so make sure to look forward to it! (SPOILERS FOR BOTH UMINEKO AND HIGURASHI!!)\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F\\_SMiKIDYEs&amp;ab\\_channel=TSU](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F_SMiKIDYEs&amp;ab_channel=TSU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can take it at your leisure and just enjoy the ride... But if you're looking to spice things up a bit, I've got just the thing for you: A contest, with a prize for the winner!\n\nIf that managed to peak your interest, here are the rules for participation:\n\n\u2022 You can only commit to one theory per episode, so choose wisely because you'll have to bet all your chips on it (Comments with two theories or more will be promptly disqualified.)\n\n\u2022 You can only post it under this post (Since it'd be easier for me if it's all gathered up in one place.)\n\n\u2022 You'll have to answer ALL the episodes correctly (Say you were right about every episode but one, it'll still count as a loss.)\n\n\u2022 Each episode you'll solve correctly, you get a point.\n\n\u2022 In addition to the that, you'll get an extra point if you're the first one to solve an episode correctly.\n\n\u2022 I won't tell you if your answer was correct or not.\n\n\u2022 I'll keep a count on each contender's score and the person with the most points will win the prize!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of side notes:\n\n\u2022 Due to work and stuff, the releases between each episode may vary in some capacity. I want to release an episode every two weeks, but I can't promise to commit to that. I don't want to not meet your expectations, so I'm just putting it out there. I hope you'll understand and bear with me!\n\n\u2022 I'm clueless when it comes to editing, so I resorted to handmake all the panels with Hikuastel, put them in a PowerPoint presentation, add a couple of sound effects and OSTs, before finally recording myself clicking through it. It's not the most conventional way of doing it but it makes do. If you got any other alternatives a newbie like me can wrap their head around, please tell me!\n\n\u2022 I didn't mean for the background to be Bernkastel holding Lambdadelta in a chokehold. Youtube didn't let me change it back and wanted me to post my face or my ID first, which I didn't feel like doing.",

However, what I wanted to ask, is maybe there is a story that has such deep complexity that is present here?\n\nI mean, every character has so many things and details to be explained by them, some you can guess (like Kyrie-Battler), some you just get told to and get amazed (like uu-uu), and just explaining every relation in the game takes so much time (like, you can't even spoil this game easily without explaining a lot, and explaining all the characters takes so much time, like the bunnies, the stakes, everything has a rich backstory).\n\nSo yeah.

Eliminating the adults because i don't think 12 yo battler will be talking to adults in that tone.   \n2. Kanon wasn't there at the time, so eliminate him.     \n3. He was talking about Jessica being her type, so eliminate her.   \n\nNow remaining people who were still kids at that time: george and shannon.    \n\nGeorge: i don't think they will go gay+incest because uhh, yeah, i don't think that needs explanation.     \n\nSo in conclusion beatrice was born from Shannon's love for battler....     \n\nI am pretty sure this is how it should be, but the procedure and what not, the reasons and other stuff, i will leave to the story to explain.   \nSo ig shannon is technically confirmed to be the culprit if she made beato, even if unintentionally lol.",

        "selftext":"After a long time (I started reading it at the beginning of 2021) I finally finished the first four episodes. I just love this story and I'm happy with myself for deciding to read it even though I've never read a VN before.\n\nAlliance of the Golden Witch was *definitely something*. It felt both the shortest and the longest episode. It added so much and made the story even more complicated, specially in Ange's backstory; for example at the hotel before going to the island Maria appeared to help Ange summon the Sisters again, but later in the boat suddenly Maria's angry\/depressed about what Ange did in the classroom a few years before? That's the only part I don't get.\n\nAbout the Rokkenjima part, it was still entertaining and suspenseful. I just love how every time the board starts Beatrice finds a way to mess with everything and Battler's head.\n\nSpeaking of him, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ABOUT BATTLER NOT BEING BATTLER. They dropped the biggest bomb of the episode and carry on like it was nothing. I can't wait to discover the truth about that in the next episodes.\n\nThe climax of the episode during the last murders was amazing, and surprisingly funny during the Virgilia scenes. After seeing her as this authoritative and diplomatic figure in the previous episode it was hilarious now with her being constantly mocked by Gaap and humiliated by Krauss and the Goats (I literally had to stop reading because of laughter at her reaction to the numbers increasing in the screen during the confrontation with Krauss)\n\nI also loved how the story talked about anger and how sometimes we show it so we can suppress the sadness we carry inside. I think one of the strongest characteristic of this VN is that it isn't just a mystery\/fantasy story but also a beautiful story of the human condition, specially love, sadness and trauma. \n\nTalking about sadness, I just can't stop feeling sad about Beatrice. I know she was supposed to be this evil witch but I can't shake the feeling she's more of a victim of circumstances than we're lead to believe (and the ending with Lamba and Bern pretty much confirms that- poor Beato she's just another piece of a bigger board).\n\nAnd about that ending, it completely changed my perspective of Lamba and even Bern. Before I thought of them as mere witches confronting each other for some unknown reason, but that ending made me realize that they only do it *for fun* (unless I'm wrong and the story reveals something later on) and how powerful they are to manipulate the entire story in their respective favor. They call themselves witches but for me they're like two powerful beings beyond human comprehension, and therefore the most terrifying characters of the entire story.\n\nAbout the solutions to the mysteries... The only thing I'm sure of is the small bombs since I've seen them being mentioned in some memes (unless that's just that: a joke and not a reality in the game) and even Lamba avoids denying it in red. But about the other mysteries, I don't have a clue. I just have this feeling that the truth of it all will be a mindfuck never seen before and I'm excited for what's about to come.\n\nAs of right now I'm burned of it, and considering I took breaks for months between episodes there's still a long time until I start episode 5 (or probably not, the truth is so close...), but reading this series during the last two years, listening to the soundtrack almost everyday, and guessing what's all about has been the most entertaining and beautiful experience of my life. And even if the next episodes aren't as good I will still love this story and its characters!\n\nP.S.: Fuck EvaBeatrice",

Ronove's answer makes no logical sense, here - if Battler can't trust red to be truthful about whether or not witches exist, he has no reasons to trust it at all. And the usual implied answer to this, \"she can't, because witches don't actually exist\"...\n\nHere are things that I believe Beatrice should be able to say in red:\n\n\"I am a witch!\u201d - indeed, you, the meta-being who routinely conjures apparently physical things and people and entire worlds from nothing, are a witch.\n\n\"Beatrice exists on the gameboard!\" - indeed she does; Kanon and Shannon do, and this is analogous.\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard is a witch!\" - indeed she is, in a sense that a some women in Medieval age were witches and some TikTok users right now are witches.\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard is an incorporeal being!\u201d - sure, you can pretty reasonably call thoughts and personality traits and behavior patterns - software, in a word - incorporeal.\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard is not a human!\u201d - thoughts and personality traits and behavior patterns aren't feather less bipeds exactly.\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard is capable of magic!\" - sure, she is capable of stage magic, as well as mental self-manipulation (and quite good at it too) and what is generally referred to as \"ritual magic\".\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard is capable of real magic!\" - yeah, the things listed in the paragraph above aren't fictional or false, they are real, they just don't violate physics.\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard have committed murders using the incorporeal stake demons she conjured!\u201d - Sure, she probably have used the mental constructs of said demons (that she have indeed conjured) in her visualization when committing murders.\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard is the witch from the legends!\" - Sure, at this point many of the legends do literally refer to her, being started by Shannon or Kanon or Genji or Kumasawa.\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard wields overwhelming power compared to everyone else on it!\" - she does.\n\nWhat can't she say in red? \n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard is capable of violating what most of mankind's scientists consider to be physical law.\"\n\n\"Beatrice on the gameboard have lived for a thousand years\"\n\n\"Beatrice have committed murders without the use of physical means to ending the victim's life.\"\n\nBut like. That's either really narrow or really technical.\n\nShe CAN say \"Beatrice on the gameboard is a witch! She is, indeed, the very witch from legends about Beatrice! She is an incorporeal nonhuman being capable of real magic, and she is overwhelmingly more powerful than anyone else on Rokkenjima! She used her magic and demons she conjured to carry out her murders!\u201d\n\nTechnically all of this is true. EDIT: TECHNICALLY true. ON FLIMSY TECHNICALITIES. Yes, she can't actually warp reality. It's all as true as me claiming I am capable of real magic because I know some real card tricks and people call them \"card magic\" sometimes. Why am I getting downvoted and told obvious things. \n\nImagine Battler hearing it, though. Or readers, before Chiru.\n\nShe absolutely wouldn't want to say this.",

        "selftext":"So I've noticed this stupid trend for a while that always annoys me to no end whenever I notice it, the punching bag character. There's sometimes that one character that unreasonably sufferers compared to everyone else to the point I go from liking the series to straight up hating it, and a lot of the time, they don't even deserve it, or there are characters way more deserving of that treatment.\n\nSo for the past few days, I've been binging the Umineko manga since I decided to read it on a whim, and I started to notice Rose usually isn't allowed just to die or get tortured for maybe a few minutes before dying like the rest of the cast. Like she doesn't even get the chance to die, the villain usually decides to torture her for eternity, and an outside force has to stop it, it gets so bad it becomes an actual plot point that Battler, who became desensitized to seeing his family brutally murdered over and over again became disgusted and how badly Rose was treated.\n\nLike yes she abuses her child but the amount of torture she goes through is stupid and way past what she deserves and what makes it worse is that it usually happens right after the plot convinces she changed and will finally treat Maria right, so not only does she have to suffer but her child does as well while Rose is forced to watch as she's being tortured as well. Her seemingly becoming a good mother only seems to be there just to add to her torture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get it Umineko is a cruel series, but it seems the author straight up hates Rose when there are far worse characters than her who usually get some redemption or a cool moment before they die but no dignity for Rose. Even Beatrice, the person who did all of this, and is just the worst, is not tortured and the series goes out of its way to make her likable. While with Rose the series actively tried to make you hate and just when it seems to be trying to get you to like her bam she gets unreasonably tortured.\n\nLike seriously, the way Rose is treated brings down the whole series for me and makes me hate it.",

        "selftext":"Well, well, well, where the fuck do I begin? I was beginning to love Beatrice, you know! She was so cute in some scenes. At times I thought, \"am I supposed to feel bad for her?\" And midway through the episode, I was like, \"Yeah, no way I am going to forgive her.\" But by the end, she had me totally fooled and under her spell.  And don't even get me started on Virgilia and Ronove. They were such likeable characters and I couldn't wait to see more of them. WTF! That devious smile of Virgilia is etched into my brain. Man, what a plot-twist.\n\nThat being said, I do have a few questions. I am writing them for my own convenience in the future and in case, some saint on reddit decides to indulge me and answer the questions:\n\n**1**. Was anything we saw with regards to Beatrice's flashback with Virgilia even real?\n\n**2**. Was there any truth in Beatrice's act? It seemed to have hints of truth in it at times. Like when Ronove said that Beatrice had never had a friend, I really thought that Battler was like her first playmate or some shit like that probably explaining why she \"liked\" him.\n\n**3**. What even was Eva Beatrice? Did she even exist? Or was it all an illusion?\n\n**4**. Does anybody other than Battler and Ange know about the game? kinzo, at times, seems to imply that he knows that everything that is happening is a game between Battler and Beatrice.\n\n**5**. Did any of the new characters besides Ange even exist? Like Virgilia and Ronove?\n\n**6**. At the end of Episode 3, if Beatrice had not made a creepy face, Battler would have signed the papers. Why would she not go straight for the kill?\n\n**7**. Lambdadelta chides Beatrice for not wanting to win if i understood the dialogue right. If that is the case, THEN WHAT DOES BEATRICE WANT?\n\n**8**. Are the events of Episode 3 completely different from events of Episode 2 and 1?\n\n**9**. Does anybody besides Battler know about what happened in previous episodes? Kanon seemed to imply when he got killed by Beatrice that he knew what she did in Episode 2 unless I misinterpreted the dialogue.\n\n**10**. Is the Battler battling with Beatrice alive in a physical body or is he in a kind of spiritual state?\n\n**11**.  I'm curious, what are the boundaries of \"red dialogue\"? For instance, why couldn't Beatrice simply declare, \"I am a witch, and you are wrong, Battler\"? I realize it may sound like a silly question, but after seeing how Eva used it in the end, it seems like she essentially confirmed that she is a witch through \"red truth\" dialogue.\n\nOf course, if any of the answers to the aforementioned questions are spoilers, please do not answer. I asked the questions under the assumption that I am a dumbass and did not fully comprehend the dialogue.\n\nThis episode was a HUGEEEEEE step-up from the previous 2 episodes in terms of just sheer excitement. The first 2 were good but this is on another level. Can't wait to read the next episode!",

        "selftext":"I got some questions and created some confusion whenever I write something about EP5 and people didn't know about it. Well, I expected people would skim the text to find out but I guess it's my personal way of thinking. I'll organize it in a way that it's easy to understand why that point is interesting.\n\nAnyway, this list was fun to write and I hope some will add these ideas to theirs and maybe it help some to solve the mystery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **About the \"red key\"**\n\n*  The red key is human red truth and is different to the usual red truth\n\nBy definition, it's human truth in red. It could be a human proof like finger tips, testimony or a simple memory without falsehood.\n\nIn Ep5 it's easy to tell when a \"red key\" is used. Whenever it's said the speaker is a human or stand on the \"detective\" 's side. Known users are the cast of the Eiserne Jungfrau (by extension, Erika) , Battler, Natsuhi and Bernkastel. **Bernkastel** is a special case because, depite being a witch, she **is a detective in this game**. This'll detailed later.\n\nOf course the **red key** is still red truth, however it matters **HOW and WHERE** you get this. It means not every red truth is a red key and that ability to say a red truth without any basis belongs to the game master.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: lparchive.org](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qlrw2eqowlva1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ca879006d53e60c28757e19da088b1993a5387c8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The use of the red key is suspicious and it's the reason why Lambda put a restriction on it\n\nI think the only restriction was  '*the window was never opened after it started RAINING*' (In any case someone want to argue about wordplays: it wasn't specified if it was one or all windows because Japanese language has no singular or plural). The way how the red truth is created should show why Cornelia was stopped by Lambda: The windows were checked before it started raining. It seems Lambda interfered because she wanted Battler's theory right and Kinzo escaped the room. However, let's put it in another way. The study door was closed, the study keys were hidden by Natsuhi and the adults have to force their way by getting in through the windows. Rudolph, climbing the ladder in **the rain,** smashed one of the windows and **opened** a window from the inside.\n\n&gt; Because of his unstable footing, this took a lot of effort... Using the end of the hammer skillfully, he brushed aside the now fractured bits of glass and opened the hole further, stuck his hand through it, and unlocked the window. \n\n It's a contradiction, however, it's not a logical error if one of the windows **was left open.** I theorize it's a measure by the mastermind to check the study without needing any keys. &gt;!Rudolph, being an accomplice, locked the window. !&lt; The red key was hold by Eiserne Jungfrau...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: lparchive.org](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dsnyt049llva1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d8fe656695994bb2b58528a2633f1d9753a0ecfc)\n\nLet's move to the court chapter. Beatrice was quite shocked by the fact why Bernkastel was able to say many things in red truth. It's true Beatrice introduced the rule but the **red key was introduced in EP5.** I already mentioned about Bernkastel's detective status, therefore, she should play by the rules (Knox). What does this means? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Red keys about the 4 victims in the Guest House\n\nMost of them are about the alibis of Nanjo, Kumasawa, Gohda and Battler. An interesting point is how Erika checked Battler's alibi and nothing ordinary happened in the cousins room. Erika said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: lparchive.org](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ws3d24frnlva1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6c34c817f00460db81757f5a7c6171cfa606b8e5)\n\nI assume she didn't heard someone else breathing. So, are the victims dead after 3:00 am? Because the \"victims\" are missing after the group returned to the Guest House and the red truth that none of the corpses were moved indicates that they are alive and faked their death... but I theorize the 4 weren't in cousins' room after Battler returned. After Rosa returned, they painted the magic circles and moved to **another room in the guest house.** That explains why Erika only talked about listing Battler's breathing. This'll mean the **crime is possible in the guest house but the cousins' room.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Red keys about Krauss and Genji\n\n&gt; \"This is all information gathered from the people involved. It isn't a red truth without a basis. It's a truth due to proper reasoning constructed from testimony. Not only testimony, but the limits of scientific investigations such as collecting fingerprints were used here.\" - Erika\n\nBernkastel has a lot in her sleeves. I would say Bernkastel does not noticed the 24h court session because Erika wasn't expecting it. The witch of miracles could say the **deaths of Krauss and Genji in red  truth**. I think we should've reached a simple basis where **Erika is a suspect** because the Bernkastel is able to say **too much facts**.\n\n&gt; \"I, I don't know... However, I seriously don't want to give up...! Aunt Natsuhi was just caught in a cowardly trap. Erika's reasoning has fallen for that trap completely...! So whether it's intentional or she's being manipulated, Erika is aiding the true culprit.\" - Battler\n\n Erika investigated the mansion and found out  '*Genji never left the mansion after 24:00*' despite **searching the whole mansion for Kinzo**. It's likely Genji hid sometime after leaving the resting room after the seal was broken and was later killed in the mansion. Therefore, the adults were pretending at searching for Kinzo (because they knew he was dead)\n\n&gt;'Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit. And he was killed long ago, shortly after you heard his voice over the phone, get it?'\n\nHere we can also see that Bernkastel accepted the phone call and this is proof that this red key was made on the basis of the culprit's doing not Erika's investigation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Battler's red key about Kinzo\n\nWe know that Battler hasn't an objective view. Anything what happened in the dining room after finding the gold could be false (like Krauss and Genji returning to the room). But Battler made a red key statement to prove he isn't the detective. He witnessed Kinzo (not someone who is a new Kinzo).\n\n&gt;*In this game! When I figured out the device of the epitaph's riddle, I witnessed Grandfather. ...As has already been shown in red, Grandfather doesn't exist. It was impossible for me to witness him! Therefore, it has already been shown that my viewpoint wasn't objective!!*\n\nObviously, we should expect he was lying or mistaking. But he clearly said he witnessed Kinzo.\n\nHe added that he wasn't lying with a blue truth:\n\n&gt; \"Therefore, my perspective in this game is based upon the 9th, not the 7th...!! The fact that I claimed to have seen Grandfather is proooooooooooofff!!!\" \n\nIf Battler really means it he have witnessed a **dead Kinzo**. I theorize the corpse of Kinzo was somehow put near the path to the church...like a scarecrow. Would this mean it was anticipated Battler would solve the epitaph and walk there? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Other red keys worth mentioning\n\nAn important hint was Natsuhi's red truth about that she told Shannon she liked autumn. There's not much to say about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.   **About the detective status**\n\n*  Knox's 7th special clause\n\nIt was mentioned by Lambda that the rule has a special clause. **It was never** **ommited.** In fact Battler has to used this to disprove his detective status in the 5th game. Here's is the official description about the clause.\n\n&gt; This applies only where the author personally vouches for the statement that the detective is a detective; a criminal may legitimately dress up as a detective, as in the [*Secret of Chimneys*](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Secret_of_Chimneys), and delude the other actors in the story with forged references. - source:[07th-expansion.fandom.com](https:\/\/07th-expansion.fandom.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* the detective's authority\n\nIs easy to misunderstand but the detective's authority simply refers to the event were the investigator should be allowed to visit the crime's place. In other words: Gathering information that the reader has a fair chance to solve the mystery . But the force behind the authority is Bernkastel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: lparchive.org](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2ek0vhiwhmva1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b92c3b6fca1cfcfa38f9deecf32529d91eb9c8a6)\n\nIt's already stated that Bernkastel controls Erika's and  Battler's piece (because he wasn't participating) so why should she edge Piece-Battler with Erika during the investigation? I think it is just a show and setting an example to the reader. In reality, the adults were using Erika and Battler stopped Erika before she could open the closet. \n\n**Erika's view in the story was almost void.** The real hints Bernkastel was gathering are the **red keys.** Most of them were gathered by Erika were unmentioned in the story until the court chapter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.   **About Erika - questions**\n\n*  The meeting with Maria in the rose garden\n\nMaria is really obsessed with her rose. What did Erika do when she met Maria? Maria was spoke neutral about Erika when she returned back to the mansion. Therefore, Erika shouldn't have explained that Maria's rose isn't there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Talking badly about Krauss\n\nThere is pretty much nothing Krauss would be acting arrogant in front of Erika and he was also joking about having Erika as his daughter. Why did Erika think he was a braggart? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Knowing about the Head's Ring\n\nWhen the Battler explained his theory how Kinzo dissapeared from the study Erika said this:\n\n&gt;  ...Interesting. I see, you are the Ushiromiya family head, the one who bears the Head's Ring. That should more than qualify you to stand in for Kinzo-san. \n\nThe Ring wasn't mentioned in front of her and she asked for everyone's testimonies after this case. How can she know about the Ring? And why did she knowabout the symbolism of this object?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Checking the shutters from the outside\n\nWhen everyone but Erika went to the guest room she was outside and checked the shutters. When and where did she possibly know which room was the right? Did she followed Eva and didn't think it's suspicious?\n\nEverything else important was covered in the red key section.",

Also warning for speculation lol\u2014I don\u2019t think this question has a concrete answer nor was it intended to have one, but I think making headcanons from textual evidence is fun anyways.\n\nAnyways, what do you guys think are the possible \u201clogic errors\u201d that Bernkastel and Lambdadelta escaped?\n\nIt\u2019s fairly obvious and implied that the logic error Bernkastel experienced is a reference to Rika\u2019s time looping (originally or including goutsu), but what do you think *caused* this to happen? What do you headcanon the flaw of featherine\u2019s game board to be, what was the contradiction? Do you think it has anything to do with Lambdadelta\u2019s interference in Featherine\u2019s game (her sponsoring Takano)?\n\n\nLambdadelta\u2019s origin is much more uncertain. I know that lots of people think Satoko becomes Lambdadelta after goutsu, but in my opinion, this just doesn\u2019t make much sense in the context of Umineko. IIRC Lambdadelta is explicitly older than Bernkastel (part of the reason she constantly refers to Bern as \u201ckid\u201d is that she\u2019s literally an older witch), so it would be strange for her to be born from the same logic error as Bern, no? Anyways, there\u2019s virtually no information about Lambdadelta\u2019s original game if you assume she is not Satoko. Which means you can speculate about whatever you want lol. I\u2019m just curious if anyone has any headcanons about her logic error that they think makes sense for her character! :)",

        "selftext":"I have a group of 3 players and they were looking for something more narrative. So I am thinking in creating a mystery campaign based in a simple system like Fate or even Call of Cthulhu.\n\nThe core idea would be that each player represents one of the kids but Maria. A first session based on interacting with the whole cast and ending with the first or second twilight, while in the second session I would end with a simplified tea party and making a first introduction to the red and blue sentences so, when they play the second part they have already something to do. I think I can easily adjust the game for 3 players by simplifying some stuff.\n\nBut this poses several questions. Players should be able to interact with the world. But unlike the VN, they have agency. And there's some mysteries that can easily be solved by investigating the corpses. i mean, just think what will happen if George decides to investigate the corpses of the first twilight of the first game.\n\nAdditionally, I am affraid they feel railroaded. The point of the game would be solving the murder mystery, or so they will think at first m they need to consistently fail to be able to understand how important is love.\n\nThis poses another question. How could I showcase episode 4 or equivalent? Ange is, as far as I am concerned, the real main character of the VN. Yet, episode 4 would be just an information dump. \n\nI think that after the second episode I will just let the players try again dumping the information required on each subsequent episode. I want that one of the players \"understand\" the game so they will have to prove they understand the game.\n\nI think a role playing game like this would be a blast m but on the other hand, player agency may just break everything. But if I remove agency, what's the point of playing the game? They've better play the VN. In fact, I want them to like the game so much that they decide to play Umineko.\n\nSo, Umineko fans who also play role playing games: I summon thee.\n\n\n- How could I design this adventure?\n- What pitfalls may happen?\n- How to deal with these situations?\n- Any reference? Did someone try something similar?",

        "selftext":"So, I've been trying to solve Bern's game for a few days.  My theory was the following:\n    The culprits are Jessica, George and Maria.  One of them hid in the dining room after killing six people and waited.  When Gohda opened the door and the corpses were found, the culprit left their hideout and joined the group as if they had just come with others.  Same with Natsuhi and Krauss.  Bern said no one joined the group while they were leaving, but the culprit actually joined them while they were coming.  Other kills are pretty easy\n   Why do I think it has to be George, Jessica and Maria?  Well, killing Nanjo in itself is impossible because Jessica said he was killed, George said he couldn't be killed in the guest house, and Battler said he didn't leave the guest house, so obviously at least one of them is a liar\n   Three theories are possible here: Jessica x Nanjo (she lied that he was dead), Jessica x George x Maria (because Jessica said the cousins \u200b\u200bcouldn't kill Nanjo, Gohda and Kumasawa and Maria said that George couldn't kill the adults,  only children and only child is Maria) and Battler x someone who considered to be \"dead\" (but I'm assuming none of them could be alive unless Nanjo lied about their deaths, which brings us back to Jessica)\n    I tried this and some other theories but they were all rejected by the game and I don't know where I made a mistake.  Maybe I misunderstood some purple or red truth?  I'm pretty sure Jessica must be the culprit because she lied in every scenario I've reviewed.",

At first I only thought Shannon=Kanon but after thinking about \"who\" Beatrice is, Zepar &amp; Furfurs Game and general interactions between those 3 characters I feel like that all 3 are the same person. \n\nA very big hint towards that was when someone asked Battler to which sort of girls he likes that was probably 6 years ago and that person would be Shannon\/Kanon\/Beatrice. (Also at the end of episode 4 Beato said basically the same thing about Battlers taste of women) Yet I think this is not everything about Beatrice considering the two Beatos, Beato dying and her personality\/Intention.\nThe theory I had before was Beatrice being the true child of Asumu. Kyrie said that Asumu got a child at the same time she got one (Kyries child didn't make it) and since Battler is not the son of Asumu that child could of Asumu could be Beato since it was said she is 19 and Battler 18 so he was born a year later? I actually like this theory more and hope that this has some \"true\" to it since all 3 being the same person feels.. weird? (I don't like love triangles\/more than a triangle)\n\nWithout love it cannot be 'seen' \nI see this as a hint towards the 3\/2 being one person aswell as Beato's intention\/goal of showing Battler her love and showing him the truth.\n\nFor culprits I had Rudolf and Kyrie for the whole time but now with that revealed a lot of the murders would be easily explained with Shannon &amp; Kanon being the same person so I think \"they\" might be the mastermind\/culprit.\n\nThe sin of Battler is what I'm lost at. I can only think of Battler forcing something onto Beato\/him forgetting the person Shannon Kanon and Beatrice are. Since his sin was 'not remembering'.\n\n4\/6&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2 would be my rating of the episodes.",

For me this is a blessing as much it is a curse. It is good to have read something so great, but it gets annoying how every great piece of art i consume is just not enough. And for that reason I ask recommendations from people that were in the past in the same spot as I, have you experienced something EVEN BETTER? if so, tell me, i'm eager to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: some people are misunderstanding what i meant lol, it's ok I wasn't clear. What I asked was to people that had umi as their favorite thing ever to say what overtook the spot as their favorite. I'm well aware that this is a matter of taste but I am highly intrigued to experience something that moved someone even more than umi. I surely wasn't expecting replies touching the meaning of preferences and \"peak fiction\"",

I really liked the OG higurashi and was wondering if the anime counterpart for this light novel series is also worth watching. How does the anime adaptation hold up to the original medium? Is it poorly paced with lots of info missing or rushed, or is the anime adaptation actually good? I don't really trust scores on MAL so I didnt know what to think. Thanks!",

        "selftext":"Umineko is one of my favorite pieces of media of all time because of how impressive it is on a technical scale writing-wise, but for a while (really until episode 7) I was sure that Beatrice was literally responsible for killing everyone with magic. I interpreted the fundamental concept as Battler trying to come up with a possible human culprit to deny the existence of Beatrice.\n\nI never really bothered theorizing about the culprit, because I didn't actually believe a human culprit existed. I viewed the battle between Beatrice and Battler as a fight by Battler to use logic and reasoning to make a theory that would be able to fit the increasingly difficult criteria presented by Beatrice via red truths.\n\nAs for why Beatrice didn't declare \"magic is real and killed these people\" in red truth if this were all the case, I assumed it was because there would be no gameboard if she could just do that, and she really enjoyed cornering Battler (a theory supported by her absolute sadism throughout e1-4). \n\nWith this interpretation it was definitely harder to side at all with Beatrice until Episode 7, and I mainly sided against Bernkastel because of her cruelty and lack of respect for Battler\/Beatrice's gameboard. I sided with Battler because of his desire to give Beatrice a fitting death, not the cruel deaths Beatrice imposed upon the family. \n\nI think the biggest reason this interpretation made sense for me for so long was because I had recently read Higurashi, and viewed the looping fragments as similar to Rika's 1983, and magic was presented via Hanyuu and the concept of fragments in Higurashi. \nOh well, I just find it interesting that such a fundamentally different interpretation still lead to a satisfying conclusion. If anything, I think this interpretation made me empathize with Ange all the more in episode 8, as I felt somewhat cheated that I didn't know the truth in its entirety even after episode 7. Regardless, the ending was fantastic and I am amazed by the narrative and meta-narrative depth achieved by Ryukishi in Umineko.",

Maybe I missed the clues and should have seen it coming but it doesnt take away that the reveal itself was just... lame.\n\nCorrect me if im wrong but his sin was that he made a promise to Shannon when he was a kid and forgot about it.\n\nThats it?\n\nI had a feeling there was something between her and Battler at some point but I didnt expect nor want Shannon to have almost half the importance she did in what was supposed to be Beato's episode. Like 40 percent of the epsiode is about Shannon instead.\n\nThen its revealed Shannon gave her feelings to Beato which kind of deflated a lot of things even further. Makes some of the interactions between Battler and Beato feel hollow knowing the origins of her feelings came from another person.\n\nAgain my issue isnt that i didnt see the reveal coming is just i didnt like what the reveal was.\n\nTbf i could have gotten many things wrong here so let me know lol. Am in the minority on this?\n\n\nEdit: Did some research as I dont have the time to replay this and figure it out on my own. And yeah... I was way off lmao. Now i understand the importance of ep 7.

        "selftext":"Really loving it a lot, but imo the \"love\" aspect of the story completely hijacks the mystery for me to the point that i sometimes stop caring about that and am too busy mourning lmao.   \nThe mystery build up till now is really great none the less.     \n\n\nSo about the culprit theories, i think there are 2 possibilities:.    \n1. The murderer is different for each ep and one of the family members on rokkenjima, but in the end, something goes wrong and they end up dying themselves, exception is eva.    \n2. Its shannon\/kanon for each: the reason for this is, before that scene of ep 4 i wouldn't have even thought about it, but they talk about how they have the memories of all the games while locked up???? That's just hella sus enough, but another thing i noticed is that, i read the vn and manga together (manga almost just for the art) but i noticed after finishing ep 4 i had the ep 2 tab open, and the jessica+kanon death scene was happening, she asked him his real name but then died before it was revealed. Doesn't that mean the red truth is satisfied because they aren't even shannon\/kanon and their real name is smth different? That will destroy beatrice's \"shannon\/kanon is dead\".   \nI didn't check if they match all of the red truths but imo they are definitely sus, i mean, the fact that they remember the games is sus enough.\nThough, i gotta say, i have absolutely no idea why they would kill jessica\/george, there's probably a catch to it or they didn't do it willingly.    \n\n\n\nSome non-mystery talk:.     \nMy favorite relationship was rosa and maria, their conclusion(?) In ep 4 just broke me, rosa had such a terrible situation, all out of her control, and maria denies her mother and uses magic as a coping mechanism, that's just too sad, i am not hoping for a scene of them making up again, they probably just reached a tragic conclusion.    \nEp 4 maria killing rosa and ep 2 rosa and maria's last stand are my 2 favourite scenes along with the beatrice vs battler in ep 4 tea party.    \n\n\nEp 4 ending also makes me believe beato isn't really \"evil\" and is probably doing this because of some other reasons, because i don't see how its possible to redeem her otherwise, and battler and her are even a couple up ahead from what i know from pics.   \n\nFav eps:.    \n4&gt;3(though, fuck eva-beatrice, really hate her in every way)&gt;2&gt;1.     \nYeah.... It just got better and better.    \n\nFav characters:.    \n1. Ange(my love, why did you have to die\ud83d\ude2d)   \n2. Rosa (she's terrible but i love her character overall)\n3. Battler(he's just nice idk???)    \n4. Beatrice (really epic villain).    \n5. Maria(must protecc).   \n\nAlso WORLDEND DOMINATOOOORRRR AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH",

Ikuko and Battler lived together about 42 years throughout and it's was nothing special if they have a baby and married(Battler even take a name Hachijo Tohya) so it explaine how she looked so young in her ~70s. I also thought that previous Hachijo Ikuko already died and Battler just live with his daughter and she behaves like her mother (previous Ikuko) same it do Beactrice(Yasu) when she behave like Beatrice who gived gold to Kinzo, or that she is a Kuwadorian Beatrice too, but she isn't, so I think that with Ikuko the same story.\nSo is it really Hachijo Ikuko in the end of episode 8 a Battler's daughter?",

Here I think it is safe to assume that everything that happened to Ange is \"true\" and everything else is some sort of delusion. But that also does not work since this \"true\" reality also have branches. jumped off the building\/did not jump off the building. Went to the island\/did not go to the island. So this implies the fantasy path is always the true path, unless she is imagining different futures in fragments as well as different pasts. !&lt; \n\nCharacters: &gt;!For the other characters I speculate that they are a spectrum of characters with different origin stories. Kinzo created Shannon\/Kanon as magical creatures through rituals. They\/Beatrice are the same. They are part human. They exist separately and simultaneously in some fragments but as only one in other fragments. In the golden land though they are all different people, since all wishes can be fulfilled.!&lt;\n\ngood beatrice: &gt;!The idea here is that in the true version all of the killings were faked. beatrice never killed or hurt anyone, aside from the island exploding thing, which happened because she could not reconcile all relationships!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I was also struck by the Sakturo\/Lion similarities. Maybe Sakturo is created in fragments where Lion does not exist.!&lt;\n\nAlternate Origin Cause: &gt;!I was expecting to see that in the ending that Ange actually went to the island with the rest. It was a perfectly normal family gathering. everything was completely made up in her head. Battler announced his engagement with Beatrice. A jealous Ange somehow accidentally triggered the explosion. Eva managed to save her but she lost her memory due to trauma. All the deceit was to keep her from remembering those events. !&lt;\n\nOverall the game did not really have the ending I wanted, but with the cat-box thing, can imagine my own endings, so there is that. \n\nFavorite image: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rNP8H24.jpg",

        "title":"Trying to solve ep 1 after reaching ep 4",
        "selftext":"\nHello! First things first, I think its best that only people that already know the solution to Umineko read this post. \nSo ive been reading Umineko for probably longer than a year already, while taking a bunch of breaks. Its kinda hard for me to stay focused on something as huge as this for a long time. So I decided I wanna reread all of it in order to refresh my memory of everything, and also try and solve everything that happened till now in the process. The only problem is that... Umineko is long as fuck. So I decided to read the manga instead for the episodes I already read! I wrote a bunch of notes and solutions to every murder and the like while rereading, and I wanna share it with this sub. Btw I reached the part in the vn in ep 4 that Lambdadelta talks to Ange about \"IN YOUR 1986 DID BATTLER ONII CHAN COME HOME?\" so please no spoilers beyond this part in the story. And btw, about spoilers... since this is such a long series, my impatient personality caused me to look at youtube comments and posts on this sub that (kinda) spoiled things for me, things that are revealed after the point I reached in the story (ep4).\n\nThe things I got spoiled on are &gt;!The existence of a person called Yasu, which is supposed to be the culprit, and that thats supposed to be Shannon (or something like that.) Also, that Shannon and Kanon are the same person? Im not a 100 percent sure about this since it was all without context. Also, how Kinzo had sex with one of his daughters. I didnt read which, but sadly I thought about it too much and that made it click in my head that its probably Rosa, and that hes probably Marias father. That would be the craziest plot twist after all. Pretty sure thats all the spoilers. I wanted to be honest about what I know, since these facts might affect my ability to solve ep 1, and its kinda unfair.!&lt;\n\nAnyway, lets start with the thoughts!\n\u2022 Maria's rose: Either was used by Gohda for the cooking, or just another mundane reason like the servants tearing it cause its ugly or the wind tearing it. But out of all the mysteries, this one feels the most intriguing, since the rose doesnt really have any use in the murders. Chekhov's gun, you know? Also, why would it disappear like that? Thinking about it in terms of writing a story, its to make Maria's situation with Rosa clear. But in terms of the culprits motive, it has no clear reason. But nothing happens for no reason.\n\u2022 Marias borrowed umbrella: Every person denies giving it, meaning someone is lying. I assume it is one of the servants, particularly Shannon or Kanon. Also makes sense since the servants with the golden eagle are probably in on the ritual. Probably Shannon since shes a young woman like Beatrice.\n\u2022 Blood on Natsuhi's door: Not really a mystery, just the culprit trying to make it seem like its magic.\n\u2022 Genji giving Natsuhi the key to Kinzo's study seems suspicious. As if he wants her to see it is empty. I think the normal response from Genji wouldve been to keep the key and just let Natsuhi try to talk to Kinzo through the door.\n\u2022 Kinzo and Natsuhi meeting: Didnt really happen, Kinzo was dead for like a year already. Why did she imagine that though...? We see that Natsuhi has some headache problems, and it might be related to that? Im not sure. What im sure of though is that this meeting never happened.\n\nFirst twilight deaths: Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, Gohda, Shannon.\n\n\u2022 Storehouse deaths: Killed by the servants, Kanon and Genji. Why would Kanon kill Shannon? Idk. I dont know the motive and reasons behind a lot of things, but this is what makes the most sense to me. Of course, the killers could also be Eva and Hideyoshi, I doubt it though. Also, electricity doesnt work and even the emergency radio doesnt work? Really suspicous for the servants. Eva and Hideyoshi wouldnt have control of such things. When you reread this, it definitely is much easier to look at this objectively. Also, with the scene that the servants tell Battler that Beatrice is real, even more suspicious of them. \n\u2022 Eva and Hideyoshi deaths: The servants lied. The door was not locked. They killed them. Them lying is the only possible way that these murders couldve happened.  \n\nA point I would like to make: Upon rereading, I dont feel the same sense of \"wtf is going on???\" and dread, which makes me think much clearer, and also makes me feel the emotion much more. When thinking that there is absolutely no way the witch exists, meaning the culprit is one of the 18, Battler's words resonate much more upon the reread. Since its a human culprit, the thought that \"how can the culprit be this cruel\" with the horrible ways he killed the family. Why would someone do something this terrible? Especially when its someone close to the family, or even a part of the family? It really makes me understand why Battler refuses to believe its one of them, cause that would be just so sad and terrible. Anyway, it just makes me feel how the mystery isnt the main point, but instead the tragedy and how sad this is. \nP.S. what is the servants motive? I really dont have any concrete evidence or idea on this but if I had to guess, probably revenge. Makes the most sense, given how the family treats them. Why would they kill themselves though? Not such a hard question to answer I think. They have nowhere to go and nothing else in life other the the ushiromiya family. So they kill themselves.\nSo far, this episode has been easy to solve, I think. I might be completely wrong with everything. But I believe that usually the most obvious answer is the correct one. I wonder if the other episodes will be as easy? I remember episode 2 had me completely not understanding anything going on (which is probably why its my least favorite (ep 3 is my favorite btw) ), so I wonder what will happen upon the reread. Although, I remember seeing someone comment on reddit once that ep 2 is easy when you reread it, so well see.\n\n\u2022 Kanon death: Either it was suicide, or Kumasawa killed him. I assume its suicide, makes more sense to me. The culprits are trying to make it seem even more supernatural because everyone is accounted for, except for kumasawa. \n\nBtw, something I would like to say is about Kanon. Personally, I really like Kanon's character. So when I read it for the first time, I didnt suspect him at all. But I suppose that isnt how this game works. He is definitely one of the cuplrits. I think ryukishi tries to trick us like that with basically all the servants. Make them some of the most likable characters. I like all of them (other than Gohda. Why would you like him. Boring and a dick.). All of the Ushiromiya adults are terrible, so it makes you want to suspect them more. Also, they have a clearer motive of trying to get the money. And in the third ep, Eva survives. But still, I believe its all to trick us.\n\n\u2022 Letter appearing on the table: Probably Genji. Could also be Nanjou. Im sure that Nanjou is also an accomplice since hes faking the fact Kinzo is alive, for example pretending to have played chess with him earlier. Im not sure if Kumasawa is an accomplice or not.\n\u2022 Nanjou, Genji, and Kumasawa deaths: This one is a bit hard. After all, theyre supposed to be the only ones that may be the culprits left. Sure, there might be a device that can kill them and wreck their face instantly that they used on themselves, but where did it disappear to? I dont think thats the case. I think the most likely case is that Shannon survived the first twilight and that the corpse wasnt actually her. How is that possible, Ive got no clue. But someone had to commit that murder. Actually wait a sec, a much more likely culprit is Kanon. Nanjo pretended he died, even though he didnt. Then he killed all of them in this case. That must be it. Kanon is also kind of feminine so Maria would believe its Beatrice.\n\u2022 Natsuhi death: This murder bothers me. Because while how it happened is easy to explain (she killed herself for some reason), *why* she killed herself is not clear, and I dont know why.\n\u2022 What happened next: What were shown isnt what happened. They probably all met Kanon and he just killed them and himself. The maria story in the bottle, Kanon probably told her to do that.\n\nSo thats is for my thoughts! It was really fun doing this, and the mystery was a lot easier than I expected. Reading the manga was a breath of fresh air, seeing how fast I finished this ep compared to reading the vn. I might do this for ep2 as well. Thanks for reading!\n\nPs. One last thought I just had. Maybe the servants motive isnt revenge? Maybe instead its some kind of \"Kinzos last wish\" sort of situation. In Beatrices letter, she wrote about how she came to collect interest and all that. Maybe Kinzo told the servants to kill everyone and themselves, and get rid of every remnant of the Ushiromiya family. This theory feels like it fits very well with the letter.",

        "title":"My Views Towards Umineko After 1.5 Years since Finishing It",
        "selftext":"Hello Everyone, I don't think you remember me, but in July, August, and September 2021, I made a series of reaction posts for each Episode of Umineko which I would make after completing each episode. Overall, I loved Umineko for its characters, themes, and its mysteries. However, as you might see in some of the reaction threads, I grew to despise the story after episode 6, even if I liked episode 8 and thought of it as the best conclusion that the story could possibly have.\n\nIt's surprising how much a year and a couple of months can change a person. You don't typically think of a year as a whole lot of time where your  entire world view could change so much, but it actually feels both like not very long ago and like an entire lifetime ago due to the amount of stuff that's changed since then. And today, I want to talk about how my perception of Umineko has changed since  I finished reading it in September of 2021.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**What has Changed?**\n\n**1) Episode 6 is actually pretty good, and reinforces the main themes of the story:**\n\nWell, first of all, looking back at some of the posts, I dunked on episode 6 so hard for reasons that I don't really agree with anymore. [Episode 6 Thread here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/umineko\/comments\/pecsrn\/episode_6_is_the_worst_episode_umineko_episode_6\/) (In case you want to follow along with what I'm saying). One of my biggest gripes with Episode 6 is that I simply hated Erika as a character, and this being the Episode where she hogs alot of the screen time, this infuriated me. I said that she was a vessel for Ryukishi07 to solve the mysteries that he can't do so with the other characters.  \n\nI read up on the fandom, TV tropes, and all sorts of places from time to time to keep reading about umineko when I felt nostalgic for it. And in doing so, I gradually came to learn what exactly the story and Literary Themes of Umineko were really all about. \n\nIf we look at the \"Without Love, it\\[the truth\\] cannot be seen\" theme of the story, we can see that throughout the novel, the idea of seeing things from other people perspectives is necessary to see the real truth of any situation or problem. Another theme was that the idea of what is true varies from person to person, and in this sense, looking at the world solely in terms of evidence, facts, and objective truth really only leads to a closeminded, cold, and pessimistic view of any situation. \n\nErika is put on center stage for most of Episode 5 and 6 as a way to reinforce these themes. She is intentionally written to be insufferable and an annoying asshole. She only ever looks at clues, evidence, and cheap tricks (the paper in the door hinge trick, climbing the ladder in a swimsuit in the middle of a rainstorm lol, etc.) to gain her own subjective view of the mystery. After this, she forces her own subjective truth onto everyone else who view it differently, whether it be due to their own emotions or relationships to those involved, and never even considers how this could impact the truth of the situation. And by refusing to see things from other perspectives, she never actually ends up solving anything and loses to Battler, who does.\n\nIt was never about the mystery itself. It was about the idea of truth, and how each character fighting in the meta world finds said truth. Honestly, this makes me respect episode 6 much more now than before. In fact, I honestly think that this was a necessary part of the story, and without it, Umineko probably wouldn't be the same. \n\n**2) The 3 Way Love Duel In Episode 6:**\n\nI also said Episode 6 spent too much time on the love duel thing, and in hindsight knowing who Yasu was and her motivations, I also see this as a necessary part of the story. Another literary theme of Umineko was about The Power of Love, and it's constantly linked to both the relationship between the author and the reader, as well as the previously mentioned ideas of truth. This love duel was the exact embodiment of these themes. Yasu seeked validation from Battler to reaffirm her identity, and when this didn't work out, it soon extended to Jessica and George as well. This duel guaranteed that she could not have her identity, otherwise known as her own \"truth\", validated by everyone. She did not have \"love\" because she was really only using all 3 of the siblings to force her own identity (or at least how she personally desires to be seen) onto everyone else without considering their perspectives, and thus \"the truth\" couldn't be seen as a result.\n\n**3) Rosa Is Abusive, but Not A Completely Terrible Mother and Maria is Actually an Antagonist in the Story**\n\nI remember thinking Rosa, albeit a character I can empathize with, is someone I didn't consider a good mother. In fact, I still think she's abusive, but with the ideas of Truth and Love and the pursuit of both of them, I honestly think she's not as irredeemable or terrible as some on this subreddit think. Maria is a character that when analyzed according to the main themes of the story, and then further compared with Ange and her development as a character, can be seen as someone who doesn't want to accept her own reality and doesn't accept her own identity for what it is.\n\nRosa has problems, and is abusive and neglectful towards her child. That can't really be justified or forgiven, but when applying Umineko's idea of viewing things from other people's perspectives, you can fully put yourself in her shoes and understand her struggles and desires. She only wants to have a normal life and have personal fun and fulfillment, one where she can have a healthy family, where she doesn't have to work as much and can have time for her daughter. This is why she goes out on dates with other guys while Maria is alone. She does force her own feelings and views onto Maria, which is abusive, but you can see how she feels about it and her desire to fix her mistakes, accept reality and move on. \n\nMaria however, doesn't do this. I mean, she is a child, but it's still clear that she retreats to her own world of magic and witches as a way to create her own identity and truth compared to the one she  lives right now. Unfortunately, no one validates this truth, and Maria refuses to see things from anyone else's perspective. By not seeing other people truth's and not going into things with good intentions (with love), she can't accept the reality in front of her. This even applies to Rosa as well, Maria thinks of her mom as being possessed by a bad witch when she's mad, and by doing this is forcing her own truth onto her mom, and as a result no one wants to validate this identity.\n\nAs a result, Maria is a complete outcast due to her inability to accept her own reality. She can't change it no matter what. By the 1986 Ushironimiya Family Meeting, she openly wishes for Beatrice to kill her entire family so that her own truth and identity (that she herself thought up of and created) could be validated. If you ask me, that's a little much, and in my opinion that's exactly why my opinion of Rosa and Maria individually have almost become mirror images of each other. Maria is a relatable character and one of my favorites, but now after re examining things I'm of the opinion that she could be considered a villain in this story.\n\n**4) Battler and Beatrice are not the only Main Characters**\n\nThis is one that I realized pretty quickly after finishing the visual novel, like less than 2 weeks after finishing it, but I thought I'd include it here. Much like Keiichi in Higurashi, Battler is just a character that best helps us understand and learn about these central ideas of truth, identity, and love. He is one of the main characters, but these central ideas are centered more around other characters than him. It's not to say he doesn't experience any of these or that he isn't the most important character, but Beatrice, Ange, and Maria seem like candidates for the title of Protagonist as well since their entire struggles are centered around these ideas.\n\nIf you were to ask me to pick one character to be considered the Protagonist of Umineko, I would go with Ange, since she is really the only character in the entire game (maybe even the When They Cry Franchise) to see that others don't accept her truth, see it from their perspectives, accept the reality of her life, and move on. She abandons the Mariage Sorciere and magic when she sees it for what it really is, a massive cope that is just an excuse to not accept the truth.\n\n In the end, she is the only one of those three to get a happy ending. Beato\/Yasu fails to have her identity validated through the adults solving the riddle instead of Battler and plunges herself off the boat and drowns in realization of what she's done to him for the sake of boosting her own ego with all these fake identities she set up. Maria is friendless, the barrier of trust between her and her mom is broken, and she openly wishes for a stranger, even if it is a witch, to massacre her entire family. Despite her being only 9, that is a very evil but sad end. Ange chooses to move on and accept the fact that her family loved her and that these last moments of their lives don't make up who they were, and despite not living in the ideal situation in life she still has hope for a better tomorrow unlike the previous two. That's why I like her so much more now and consider her to be the true main character of the story, which I guess is why she literally does become this in Episode 8. Idk, maybe Battler is the main character for the Question arcs, and Ange for the answer arcs?\n\n**5) George is still a Bitch and I Hate Him**\n\nAll jokes aside, I think he's a cool character and all, I just think he still embodies that incel type image. I remember him trying to get Shanon to forget about Battler when talking to her on one of the family  meetings while Battler was still gone. To me that just seems like he's forcing his way into this relationship, I don't like it. He is quite literally forcing his own reality onto someone else, who to be frank is also exactly like him, so I guess they're made for each other in a way. George stays as my least favorite character.\n\n**6) I Still Don't really understand Bernkastel's Motivation for Her Actions**\n\nI get that she's the embodiment of all the Rika's that failed, but other than being empty of empathy I can only really say that she represents the opposite of the phrase \"Without love it can't be seen\". Her piece Erika is the same, and to me it seems like Ryukishi is using Bern as a way of demonstrating what an approach to finding truth without love looks like. She never sees things from others perspectives, or even cares, she just fucks with people for the sake of it. Is that all there is to it? Is she basically the main antagonist of the Series? Will the Bernkastel Feet Pic on Rule34 scar me for the rest of my life? I'm honestly curious as to everyone's answer to these questions\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nThis post is getting kind of long, but for the most part my entire view of the story now relates to these central themes, so I could honestly go on forever if I wanted to. But I'm going to choose to stop it here, since I have a feeling you get the idea of how I think about Umineko as a story and a piece of media now.\n\nI wonder how all of you feel about my opinions now?",

Yes, shes a domestic abuser, but what proof is there thats shes also a pedophile?The entire point of Beatos existence was to be loved by battler in Sayos place. You mean to tell me that it was actually Rosa who who fell in love with Battler??? Then whats Kanon And Shanon's role in all of this, if theyre not the culprit? Was the enitre ep 6 and 7 meaningless?\n\nIm sorry, but this is not a good theory",

        "selftext":"(This discussion may contain spoilers)\n\nThis might be weird, but there's something I've been wondering about for a while: what kind of ship did she fall off? Why was she even there in the first place?\n\nFor a long time, due to English not being my first language and how it's usually described by other fans, I've had the assumption that Erika was on a cruise ship. In my mind, that's what \"pleasure boat\" sounded like. But is that correct? I've been googling and from what I can see, a \u30d7\u30ec\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8 looks more like a small yacht to me. I might be wrong, since I'm not fluent in Japanese. Maybe it wouldn't change much (she still fell off and we don't know why, although we can make theories), but I'm curious about the implications.\n\nWhy do you guys think she was on a ship in the ocean near Rokkenjima? This is mere speculation since we don't know much, of course, but I've heard different theories: she was on vacation with her family (on her birthday, perhaps?), she was on a school trip, etc. Whatever the reason was, Rokkenjima is a pretty isolated place, so I find it unlikely that she could be on a small boat in the middle of the ocean.\n\nI'm writing this post thinking mostly about the Erika we're familiar with, but this questions also applies to human!Erika. Are there specific details I've missed? Or simply, what's your opinion on the matter?",

I know the one from C80 (with Battler on the cover) has been scanned and is available on the wiki, but has anyone seen the illustrations from the other two?\n\nThe reason why I ask is because I've previously seen a page that was clearly scanned from this book. I'm not sure if I should post it, as it's NSFW, but it featured the uncolored illustration of Bern and Erika that was included as a pre-order bonus for the PS3 game, plus a scrapped alternate version of it.

        "selftext":"Lately I've been combing through Umineko again, trying to piece together a timeline for what happened to Ange in the real world. My understanding is that\n\n* After Eva's death, Ikuko gave Eva's diary to Ange\n* Ange read it and attempted suicide out of despair, but landed on the net. She decided to leave her inheritance to Okonogi and changed her name to avoid the Sumaderas\n* Ange's journey to Rokkenjima happened in an alternate timeline\/fragment, in which she hadn't obtained the diary and had to scavenge info by herself. She never gave Okonogi her assets, so she was hunted by the Sumaderas. This also includes her reading of Dawn of the Golden Witch, since she planned to go to Rokkenjima right after.\n\nDoes this sound like a reasonable explanation for what's going on? The only issue I noticed is that although the manga [confirms](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/l5lenfS) the diary meeting happened, the VN suggests Ange and Ikuko had never met before the epilogue (e.g. [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/L-q01sP9f3w?list=PLyL5n8z8rL-3cS8LwsauulmuwbuHgCyxX&amp;t=270) and [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/L-q01sP9f3w?list=PLyL5n8z8rL-3cS8LwsauulmuwbuHgCyxX&amp;t=664)).

        "selftext":"The truth in the light novel is depicting Eva and her husband as the culprits of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Twilight. It might be a easy solution on paper and Tohya believed Eva, as the sole survivor of the incident- is supposed to be the culprit.\n\nI claim that there is a hidden - truer- truth in Banquet. Let's say this episode was written with an ambigious truth because the author wasn't sure at the time (I'll explain it later). The \"official solution\" is tainted by uncertainties. It cannot really touch some of the essences of the mysteries which is the 'Whydunnit'. So, what makes Eva the killer? It's the gold, or better, the accident she made: killing her sister. But there is a small problem with it (which is also the problem the Prime Eva had). She stays suspicious, even after leaving the island. \n\nEva should have a plan in mind to remove any traces and make it look it's an bomb incident, right? This cannot be right. The only person who could tell her about the active bomb would be Sayo. I think this is the point which can decide whether Eva is the actual culprit or not but I don't say she killed people because of greed. \n\n* '*Eva as the accomplice of Sayo'* doesn't make much sense  Eva didn't solved the epitaph and doesn't deserve the Head's ring which wasn't showed to the detective anyway. It would probably ended how Rosa ended in EP2. This point shouldn't be true.\n* *'Eva as the solver of the epitaph and meet Sayo'* shouldn't be considered. Rosa was showed the gold and Eva didn't want to share. It also means Sayo broke her promise in the later epitaphs.\n* *Eva as the solver of the epitaph but didn't meet Sayo* would explain why she showed Rosa and being accepted as the new Ushiromya Head but shouldn't know about the bomb and the secret harbour. This contradicts with Tohya's belief he had during this time (Eva is the survivor and must be the killer). Therefore she couldn't get the credit card and the tresor key which means the PIN on the parlor's door wasn't for her- it was for Battler.\n\nI showed these 3 viewpoints why Eva as the \"obvious\" culprit is not stable. It doesn't matter which path Eva would take - unless she is like NO RISK NO FUN, but I don't believe this characterization. It not unthinkable the ending roll is false and Eva didn't even survived. I think there are more stable scenarios: \n\n* *'Eva solved the epitaph'*, found the gold and decided to tell Rosa and Hideyoshi but didn't do nothing (until the 9th Twilight)\n* *'Eva didn't solved the epitaph'* and didn't do nothing (until the 9th Twilight)\n\nThe 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Twilights can be explained with Sayo as the killer and Nanjo as the accomplice. No accidents, everything planned. \n\nGeorge's and Nanjo's death doesn't need to explained. I think the rest of the deaths are because of acting out of affect and go on Eva's account: Sayo, Jessica and Battler. Comparing the sequence of gameboard (narration) scenes and the fantasy scenes.\n\n1. Eva shot Jessica blind in the parlor.\n2. Nanjo brought Jessica to the servants' room; EVA killed Nanjo outside of the room.\n3. Kanon escorted Jessica to the parlor; Eva and Battler find Nanjo's corpse but couldn't find Jessica.\n4. Beatrice protecting the parlor's door is shot by EVA until her heart remains; Eva and Battler returned to parlor.\n\nI think many reader misunderstood Battler's saying \"you are the culprit Aunt Eva\". There is a small window the character's are not talking (where Beatrice is whispering EVA the truth about witches) but it makes sense that Eva snapped and killed Jessica and Kanon\/Shannon in front of Battler's eyes. Meta Battler's afterwords are words of ignorance (he didn't solved the game, of course).\n\nSo, what about the ambigious truth I was mentioning? Well, there lies rather big plothole in the manga adaption of the VN. It seems Tohya and Ikuko read **Confession of the Golden Witch** **before he wrote Banquet**. It was the time where Ikuko found about the Rokkenjima incident and *found* the message bottle. After that, Eva could find out where his missing nephew is and visited him ...but that's another topic. My point here is Tohya could know the real truth about the first 2 message bottles and wrote Banquet with supposedly main culprit Eva but hid the real mastermind away. The 1st Twilight wasn't a subject of the Witch Hunters and nobody questioned the rest of the deaths - they took the Eva-culprit-theory for granted which fueled the topic for the public. This could mean Ryhukishi anticipated that and we would believe the seemingly obvious solution because we wouldn't doubt Will's 'ambigious' answers. Or Ryukishi didn't see this plothole at all and threw something usable here and there. I can imagine he didn't paid much attention.\n\nWhat do you think? I am in the wrong or is my claim justified?",

I remember the timeline of episode 4 being extremely fucked so please help me with that if possible. Also please don't include any spoilers from the answer arcs.",

        "selftext":"Yesterday I have made a post, and received several answers. I want to thank eveyone who has replied. I have since figured our my main question that should be asked.\n\nMy goal is to be able to figure stuff out while reading (currently ep2).\n\nMy main question is:\n\nHow do I know which information presented on screen is reliable?\n\nI mean unless we have certain truth, there are infinite explanations for everything. It is the same as having nothing to go by. We must know something as truth, as well as have a limit to what interpretation to lie is possible.\n\nI mean, there should be the limit to what can be questioned. Otherwise nothing can be questioned.\n\nIf we further detail this, then what I want to know is:\n\n1) Can we rely on the character's locations given to us on the first night to be correct?\n\n2) When we are told something about some events that happened to someone other than Battler - like, what happened on George and Shannon's date, or Rosa Maria and Beato, what are these? \n\nAre these characters present there telling this to us (so we assume they either lie or hallucinate or msiremember or tell truth)?\n\nAre these what the witch shows Battler as her version of what has happened?\n\nLike, we see 7 people accept Beato in the chapel. Then only Rosa survived and shes acting as if whe has never been there. She's lying? Beato is lying when showing us the scene? Without rules there is no point deducing this.\n\nThe biggest offender is of couse the goat battle - how are we supposed to treat it. Like, after it happens, Battler doesnt even mention it, neither does Beato. That would be way bigger checkmate (\"explain blades and goats with human tricks\"). \n\nHow is this to be treated?\n\nIf both died - who is telling the story to us? How do we, reader, know about the goat and blade?\n\nI mean, maybe its explained later, but this is such a meta question that unless you know, there is really no way to deduce anything because unless we are given the rule about this, everything is just taking space in your memory.\n\nIt's like, you shoud skip until that rule is given, and only then fo back and read and properly interpret what you see.\n\nSo basically i'd like to know the rule now, so I can start interpreting the stuff I read, not just store it in my memory, skipping forward until all that luggage finally becomes useful.\n\nI mean, its not a story spoiler (who stole the rose, who killed the 6, etc), its something that should be there by default in order to be able to comprehend anything. It is assumed when you percieve any medium that you are given rules as to what is trustworthy and what is not. And you know the limits to explanations of nontrustworthiness.\n\nThank you.",

        "selftext":"**EDIT: If anyone finds this post, please believe me, the correct answer is the end of EP5, not EP4! EP5 contains a vital plot point in order to solve the WHY of the story.**\n\nHaving been recommended Umineko like everywhere, and being an avid thinker, I was very eager to get into the games, and try to solve the mysteries...\n\nHowever, I don't really understand... what should I be solving here?\n\nFrom what I gather from the final of EP1, you should \"learn the rules by watching the games\", which suggests that there are some rules that defy what you usually assume - for example, what people call \"unreliable narrator\", where you are shown something like Higurashi EP1, and later learn the main character, through whose eyes you were seeing, could not be trusted.\n\nDoes that then mean that there is nothing to solve until you read all 4 episodes?\n\nBut then again, the game kinda prompts you to start thinking immediately from the start. Is there an 19th person or not? What is the culprit after? Etc. But how can you figure it out from the information presented if you don't even know what kind of information can be trusted?\n\nAt least in Higurashi you had newspapers, random police officers (not Oishi) and other side characters to rely on (if you can't trust him).\n\nFrom that, you could have deduced a lot.\n\nHere, let's take EP1.\n\nWe are never shown the bodies. How can we know whether they are fake-able or not? We are never told how properly were the bodies checked for being dead, and which of the bodies were. How exactly did the doctor behave (could mean a lot to deduce whether he's guilty).\n\nWe are never told, whether the chain and window locks are close-able with human tricks or not (like, a piece of hard metal wire could be used to close or open the chain). We can assume beds are possible to hide under and never checked under them, that's for sure.\n\nSo how to eliminate suspects?\n\nWe are given story from many characters's points of view. If we trust all of them, then I think by EP2 we already almost run out of suspects, don't we?\n\nIt's not Shanon, Kanon, Genji, Kinzo, Maria, Battler, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Kyrie, Rudolf, Jessica, Gohda...\n\nSome like Maria simply had no physical ability to perform the acts, some had obvious motivation and inner dialogue and interaction that forbade them from taking part in the plot.\n\nSo we have: Krauss, Rosa, Kumasawa, Nanjo, George.\n\nHow are we supposed to narrow down further though, knowing only EP1 information?\n\nFinally, the finale, are we supposed to trust the police? That the survivors by the time \"Witch has won\" have disappeared?\n\nAnd then, we're given the dialogue between Beatrice and Bern, so, we already must know witches exist, so what was the point anyways? Witches do exist, or should we doubt this too? The discussion at the end between the witches, and the 4th wall breaking Bern talk?\n\nAnd then EP2.\n\nShanon and Kanon clearly see Beatrice perform acts defying laws of physics (burning their hands, vanishing into air). So does Rosa. Do we have to doubt them as hallucinating \/ lying to us? Then agian, Beatrice shows up. Physically. So at least, a 19th person exists. Why all the talk about \"whether she exists\" in the EP1 then? It was pointless because she existed all the time? Or did she not in EP1, but does in EP2?\n\nAre we even having the same suspect in all episodes? Or not? How are we supposed to know, mid EP2, whether to look for the same suspect, or a different one?\n\nFinally, again, we already know witches exist, so what's the point?\n\nDo we need to prove that witches exist but do not influence the world? Meaning, witches exist like Hanyuu exists, they don't actually influence the world beyond human capabilities, they only function as tools to create the repeating story, enabling having multiple ways of the same actors acting in the same setting?\n\nLike, what is the meta Battler's point? And meta Beatrice's point? How can he not accept witches exist when he talks to her? Or if he's supposed to solve the mysteries by \"human tricks\", how does that require her to reset the board (EP2), why can't they first lay EP1 to rest? Like, have him explain how Kinzo vanished, how Eva &amp; Hideyoshi died, at least 1 explanation - like, have him say, person was under the bed, and both times under the bed wasn't checked.\n\nVery confused, but still want to start figuring things out... just don't see how! Would be glad to receive explanations to what I outlined above\n\n(reading ep2 currently, no spoilers past that please)",

        "selftext":"I'm a bit recent on this fandom, but I've seen that Shkanontrice does have it's fair share amount of controversy. From arguably not fitting all the red truths, not sounding believable, feeling ridiculous, etc.\n\nIt was part of the reason the Rosatrice theory became so popular, people wanted an alternative answer that they felt answered all the red truths and hints in a satisfying way.\n\nWell, after finishing the visual novel and seeing arguments from both sides I feel that Shkanontrice happening was... Inevitable.\n\nMaybe not Shkanontrice in particular, but just either Shannon or Kanon being the culprit.\n\nI'm not arguing from the mystery side of things (I'm worse than Battler at shit) but more from the narrative side.\n\nWhoever the culprit is, even if it makes sense, it wouldn't be a satysfactory reveal if the character had problems like a weak motivation, not working as an antagonistic threat, too predictable, or is not an interesting character.\n\nFor a moment. Let's ignore the red truths, let's ignore any hints, let's ignore episode 7 and 8, let's ignore the manga, and let's ignore that Shannon and Kanon share body and soul. \n\nIt's January 2010, we only have up to episode 6 to solve the mystery and pick a culprit. If Shannon and Kanon aren't the culprits, what other character could be a satisfying reveal from a narrative perspective?\n\n# The adults\n\n**Krauss:** The guy who's whole shtick is that he tries to appear way more competent than he actually is wouldn't have worked as an evil mastermind behind this massacre.\n\n**Natsuhi:** Proving Erika right would have felt wrong. Maybe in a \"right choice, wrong reasoning\" way it could have worked but something like that could have been shown without the need of making her right about who the true culprit is.\n\n**Eva:** This would have been just plain weird, the person that Battler wrongly thought to be the culprit early on the story... Is actually the culprit. Grabbing a massive red herring and then just actually making it true would have been beyond odd.\n\n**Hideyoshi:** Not fleshed out enough for it to be a satisfactory reveal.\n\n**Rudolph and Kyrie:** While they would have worked amazingly as a threat and would have definetly created an interesting conflict with Battler, the heart of this tale would have been lame and already known from the start. Simple and plain greed is not interesting enough for a motivation.\n\n**Rosa:** This fails because it would have simply been too obvious. What, you are telling me that the woman that easily gets angry, beats her child, and spent all of episode 2 being cartoonishly evil is the culprit? Yeah, no shit.\n\nAll the adults also share the same problemas as Rudolph and Kyrie (the heart of the tale would have been too simple and obvious right frm the start, these people are assholes willing to kill for gold), and also share the same problem as Rosa (they are too obvious as suspects).\n\n# Cousins\n\n**Battler:** Yeah, I don't think I need to explain this.\n\n**George:** Actually... May unironically be one of the most solid choices for the culprit. I could go into it, but it's not needed, George simmilarly to Krauss would have make it a bit hard to work as a serious threat because of his embarassing past and goody two shoes personality.\n\n**Jessica:** Having not one, but two of her biggest moments be about how she is not willing to kill people makes it pretty clear for why this wouldn't work.\n\n**Maria:** She is a 9 year old.\n\n# Servants + Nanjo\n\n**Nanjo:** Not fleshed out enough for it to be a satisfactory reveal, plus it's hard to take an old fat man as a serious threat.\n\n**Kumasawa:** Too comedic to work as a serious threat and not fleshed out enough to be a satisfactory reveal.\n\n**Gohda:** Same problem as Kumasawa but somehow even worse as he is a huge coward and dumbass. At least Kumasawa's short scuffle with the stakes of purgatory and connection to Virgilia makes it more believable that she was more competent than what she seemed.\n\n**Genji:** Again, too underdeveloped. Plus, someone who does nothing but follow orders wouldn't have worked, knowing being the culprit would imply a fully proactive action.\n\n# Kanon and Shannon\n\n* Some of the most developed characters up to that point.\n* They embody a lot of the main themes of the story.\n* Besides Battler they are the 17 humans on Rokkenjima with the strongest and most developed connection to Beatrice.\n* Even without episode 7, it's easy to imagine the heart of the crime would involve something related to love, identity, and freedom. Any of those could easily make for a very interesting motivation that fits the story.\n* While they are teens as far as we know which could be make them hard to take seriously as a threat, the magic scenes do help to give the feeling they are definetly competent fighters. Even if they don't happen, the magic scenes always have some level of truth to it (For example: We learn a lot from Kyrie during these scenes).\n* It also helps that their characters are constantly treated with a lot of seriousness, they aren't so comedic to the point you can't take them seriously as a threat.\n* Despite all this, they would have still been very unexpected picks for the culprit knowing that at first glance they seem to be some of the nicest and most likeable characters of the story.\n\nI simply think that it was inevitable for Shannon or Kanon to be the culprit. They are the ones that work best from a narrative perspective and would have made for the most satisfactory reveal.\n\nThis make even more sense when you flip the chessboard, why would Kanon and Shannon make so much sense as the culprits? Because the mystery was written around them being the culprits of the story.\n\nMaybe not Shkanontrice, but this would have ended with Shannon or Kanon being the culprit or one of them in one way or another. Heck, the second most popular theory that goes against the official explanation is Erikantrice, which uses Kanon.",

        "selftext":"Bernkastel? \n\nRyukishi revealed in his interview \"Answer to the Golden Witch\" that Bern and Lambda only had a minor role in the story akin to ??? in ep1 and ep2, before he decided to create Virgilia and change the plot a little bit. At first, Bern was meant to be the sole guidance for the player but since that role was already occupied by Virgilia in ep3 Ryukishi gave Bern different things to work with, ultimately giving her the role of the final obstacle for Ange to overcome.\n\nThis makes me curious who Ryukishi had planned to be the main antagonist in ep8.\n\nMy candidates for that spot would be....\n\n- Featherine: She is already present in major fights in ep8 and holds the title of the strongest witch in the story. My only problem would be that she is the \"Witch of \"\"Theatergoing\"\", Drama, and \"\"Spectating\"\"\", so her actively confronting Ange would feel a little bit out of place. Although you could argue Ryukishi wanted to subvert our expectations.\n\n- Erika\/Virgilius: She acts as Bern's henchman in ep8 and her character stands for the opposite of what the story is trying to convey. I also found it a bit weird how she just comes back after her arc was finished in ep6. Maybe this might be a trace from an earlier draft where she was the main villain? The same goes for Virgilius, since Bern wouldn't have an antagonist in the version where he existed.\n\n- Black Battler: B.Battler was the main antagonist in ep3 before Ryukishi scrapped the idea and replaced him with Evatrice instead. He is the culmination of everything Ange feared her family would turn out to be and the final confrontation would be her accepting the fact that her family were terrible people who would have killed each other out of greed.\n\n- Evatrice\/Black Witch: I have no basis for this. I think it's just a neat way to finish the arc with a character who symbolizes the evil of her family members. Doesn't have to be Evatrice, just a witch-type character who resembles her family.\n\n- Current Bern is an amalgamation of the earlier Bernkastel + OG main villain: This hypothesis suggests that there was an already established villain character before Ryukishi changed the story and that Bern simply absorbed the role OG villain.\n\nWow, I was only thinking of Erika and Featherine when I started writing for this post but Black Battler vs. Ange &amp; Battler would have been so hype.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "selftext":"It's useless. The past year I've been obsessed over this VN, and since I consider it a must-read for everyone, I took the impossible task upon me of trying to recommend it to the people around me.\n\n* **\"It's just a random weeb story! One Piece is better anyway\"**\n* **\"It's too long\"**\n* **\"I never heard of this before, why should I care? It's not popular.\"** (*I wanted to strangle this guy)*\n* **\"VN's are boring\"** (*even though I clearly stated multiple times that I thought the same thing before)*\n* **\"Oh wow, cool! I don't like anime :)\"** *(IT'S NOT ANIME AAAAAAAAAAAAA)*\n* **\"Oh cool, yeah. I'll check it out... IF you check THIS out!\"** \\*proceeds to forget this deal\\*\n* *(after giving a detailed summary)* **\"Oh, so the creator just did a massive dump on his story? :)\"**\n* **\"Witches? \ud83e\udd28\"**\n\nAnd the people I got to show even the slightest of interest\n\n* **One only read for 30 minutes and said \"It's not for me\"** *(even though I said multiple times that it starts slow; the guy even sent me screenshots of all the girls he wanted to 'mate' with. Eva was his waifu)*\n* **The other is a pathological liar. He said he's reading it but... yeah... no...**\n* **\"Haha ok, I'll read it when I have time\"** *(seems like he's the busiest guy in the universe)*\n* **\"Ok, I'm a big fan of Doki Doki and unreliable narrators. But I don't have the money I to spend right now\"** \\*proceeds to waste his life savings on trading cards\\*\n\nI tried every approach: memes, as a casual recommendation, having a serious \"dude, you HAVE to read this\" moment with my closest friends, annoying blockheads to bits, saying \"this work of fiction is dear to me and I know YOU will enjoy it as well\"... nothing works.  \nI even know a guy who watched and enjoyed &gt;!(!!!)!&lt; the anime years ago. But he doesn't seem to get the \"subtle\" hints I give.\n\nAnd now it's come to a point everyone insults my love for this story.  \n**DISCLAIMER:** ***This post might make it sound like that I'm an overobsessed fanboy, but I know my borders. It's not that I can't talk about anything else or that I shoot down other's interests - quite the opposite even. There's just a huge difference in difficulty between recommending Umineko and anything else. And it's not a small group of people either. It drives me insane.***  \nGetting someone to watch and finish Boku no Pico is easier.\n\nI get not wanting to give the VN a go, it's a very niche platform in my country\/social area. But even the manga seems to be a big nono for people. They know nothing about \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc08 yet dismiss it as *\"just another weird Japanese moe kawaii desu :3 with kamehameha's and jutsu's and probably lots of sex\"*",

        "selftext":"Rosa is probably one of the weirdest characters because on one hand she is probably one of the way better written and more realistic characters, on the other she feels like wasted potential and i think she originally was planned to have a much bigger redemption arc.\n\nRosa in EP 1 is like the trope of she is nice when you know her and then the infamous scene at the rose garden happens and it's made to shock you, like how it came out of nowhere and man that is the moment that i knew that i would love umineko, and then she dies on the first twillight.\n\n\nRosa in EP 2 is the mom protag, in favour of that we get more context on her and her relationship with maria, we also get her being very intelligent especially with her manipulation skills we get more context on her backstory on the tea party in a way that explains how Rosa became rosa, and it feels very real, like if you were bullied by your already four adult sibling plus the abuse of your own parents, it is understandable why someone would become like Rosa.\n\nAnd in EP 3 she strangely has a pretty big role even thought it is supposed to be the Eva chapter, we also get strangely a lot of focus on Rosa, like when she tells her siblings the story of how she met kuwadorian Beatrice which also explains her behavior, because she saw a person dying in her very own eyes and the trauma of trying to pretend that nothing ever happened and trying to continue with her own life while having that big secret for the entirety of your life. \n\n\nAnd she also gave the hint to Eva about the gold and her interaction with Eva when they both discover the gold and we get a more skillfully and cocky side since she can handle the negotiations very well, and when she dies on the second twillight by evatrice we also get more information like her dreams and how evatrice uses all that against her.\n\n\nAnd then EP 4 comes in and while it more or less is supposed to be the quote on quote kyrie chapter Rosa  has a lot of presence.\n\n\nWe learn about her relationship with maria and how it   \nSlowly deteriorated into becoming the thing it is, and the abuse from Rosa to maria is done such a raw, powerful way that i sometimes felt that i was there with Rosa as my mom because of just how real the Rosa scenes are , they give so much powerful things to both characters and that scenes when she rips sakutaro and the bunny apart wow, and then the infamous torture scene, there is a reason why that is a very popular Umi video.\n\n\nAnd that is because how chilling and scary Rosa's words are, forget about the over the top gore, because Rosa's dialogue is so fucking chilling that it genuelly creeped me out, and Ami Kochimizui's voice acting makes the scenes feel more chilling and heartbreaking and just real like a real person, because in that scene i could just picture my mom saying those things to me it feels as if she is also insulting you the player it's just good, and how her relationships turned her into this mess of a person, how when all people in her life failed her even her own husband and she never got that help she needed how she lashes all of her trauma on a defenseless person like herself when she was a kid feels so real, and the worst part is that they could had a totally different and healthier relationship if things were different you could see that in some minor interactions like when she hums uu uu along with maria in EP 4 those hints of a better life.\n\n\n\n\nAnd in chiru however she dies on the first twillight in EP 5, in EP 6 after telling her backstory to kanon she inmediato dies on the first twillight, on EP 7 she gives a short retelling of the kuwatrice story and  is shot by kyrie on the first twillight, in EP 8 she dies on the first twillight and has that gun scene.\n\n\nIn chiru Rosa's character can literally be summarized in dies on the first twillight, and it feels o awful, because in EP 8 specially the manga it would had seemed as thought Rosa would have a more complete character arc but it got very cut off, and instead she almost does nothing in chiru, she only gets some random lines and then poof dies on the first twillight.\n\n\nIt is as if ryukishi wanted to make Rosa a more mayor character in the story who would be more important but thought the audience would be too bored of her after her screentime in EP 2 and 4,\n\n\nAnd so her only personality trait became dying on the first twillight, it is very dissapointing and a far cry of how excellent of a character she was portrayed in EP 2 and 4",

Let's say you could pick literally anyone, alive or dead, with the only condition that recordings of their voice should be easily accessible.\n\nContext: I am playing around with the idea of using AI-generated voices to create an Umineko audiobook, and then release it for free. This would be of course a project of enormous size, because it would also be cool to have the background music and all that jazz, so for the moment I am starting small and exploring what is available at the level of AI voices.\n\nThere are some online services that make it possible to create custom voices, but (from what I have seen so far) the best results are obtained by \"cloning\", e.g. fine-tuning the voice-generating algorithm to obtain something closer to an existing voice (I guess this is where all the memes with the US presidents playing games are coming from).\n\nA few candidates that I considered so far:\n\n* Christopher Lee as Kinzo\n* Alfred Hitchcock as Dr. Nanjo\n* (Younger) Maggie Smith as Natsuhi\n* Joanna Scanlan as Eva\n\nHowever, I am not a native English speaker, and my knowledge of English-speaking actors and voice actors is limited (most of the movies I watched in my life were dubbed, unfortunately).

The first game is one I have least confidence in but I think got the second one right. The epitaph though I really don\u2019t know. \n\nFirst game I think the culprit is Shanon. For the first one she knew where the key to garden shed is and stuffed all the bodies in there and returned the key. The rest of the murders are the first game are possible by her. Eva\u2019s death she was hiding in the room, and Kumasawa painted the magic circle. Then Shanon burned Grandpas body and Shanon killed Kanon. Kumasawa put the letter in the study and then Shanon killed Nanjo,Genji and Kumasawa. Shanon kills Natsuhi. \nI\u2019m gonna keep it real this one I don\u2019t get really get. \n\nSecond Game\nMy big guess on the first twilight is that the door was never locked to begin with. One the servants murdered Jessica and Shanon. The rest of the servant could have colluding together and hid the bodies. Regarding George, Shanon and Godha\u2019s bodies the was confirmation of them being dead so body double. \n\nThird Game\nThe closed room murders aren\u2019t closed the murdered just picked the key from a dead body and pretended like they found it. Eva is the killer she kills Rosa and Maria. While Hideyoshi covers for her. Then Hideyoshi get called by Battler parents and than they murdered get by Eva. Than the theory that the murdered killed Nanjo and than died making it look everyone died. \n\nFourth Game\nThe murders they were killed by a person who the acknowledged as Kinzo. Than people were knocked out and moved to the hidden mansion. Than George and Jessica were killed by this person. They went on to murder the rest with a gun, locks don\u2019t matter cause they have a master key. \n\nWith epitaph the word needs to 13 characters and my guess is The golden Land. When killing characters is you take the last letter of each body part it can cross out some letters. But I don\u2019t get anything that makes sense so IDK. \n\nWho is think Beatrice is Shanon she is the only one Battler made a promise with 6 years ago. She makes sense age wise, and she has been in focus for everyone single episode. It\u2019s not Kanon because Battler did not him before. I don\u2019t think it Jessica because she is family, Sam with George. Shanon is only that makes sense in my mind. \nThoughts would and correction would be appreciated.",

What is the significance of the family crest having its origins in the double-headed eagle as opposed to the eagle of ISR?",

We just get names and that's it. Before I can even blink, we're already at the adults with their interrogation of Krauss. I don't even know who this guy is! If I hadn't read the VN beforehand, I wouldn't know who was related to who.\n\nWe don't get aquainted to the important locations of the island, which is 101 with mysteries. Hell, stories in general. Even Higurashi's anime with its first arc took its time letting you know who the characters were, their relationship dynamics and a broad sweep of the village in general.\n\nJudging Umineko as an anime alone, its failing at simple narrative storytelling. As an adaptation, only 10 minutes in and I already know its totally ruined.\n\nI made a mistake. One which I instantly regret.

        "title":"I finished End of the golden witch and i have some theories.",
        "selftext":"As it says in the title, I finished Ep 5 of the Answer arcs. I enjoyed it, both Lambdadelta and Bernkastel worked quite well as antagonists, and I liked all the moments of Battler outsmarting the witches. and I loved how the fights are discussions with weapons.\n\nI have some theories about the truth of this chapter that I want to share.\n\nFirst of all, here are some theories that I made during the question arcs that I will use during the theories in this chapter.\n\n* **Shannon, Kanon and Beatrice are the same person.**\n\nEvery time Beato appears on the board it's when he's about to kill someone but then he talks to Shannon or Kanon and it's just a normal conversation, not only that, Shannon and Kanon never appear at the same time in front of Battler who is near. then the detective and the only reliable narrator. In episode 2 Kanon body disappears, and in episode 4 Kanon\u2019s corpse is the only one who Battler don\u2019t get see.\n\n* **There is a bomb in the mansion.**\n\nI get to thinking when Beato says these Red Truths:\n\n&gt;***Ushiromiya Battler. Now... I'll kill you.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***And right now, there's no one else on this island except you. The only one alive on this island is you. Nothing off the island can interfere.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***You are alone on this island. And of course, I'm not you. Yet I am here, now, and I am about to kill you.***\n\nA bomb is the only way of killing Battler in this case.\n\n* **There are three Beatrices**\n\nIn episode 2 Nanjo reveals that Kinzo indeed had a lover named Beatrice who died, and we also know that Rosa had met a woman named Beatrice that lives in Kuwadorian and died, and there's the Beatrice that is playing against Battler. my theory is that the second Beatrice is the daughter of the first Beatrice with Kinzo, but i don\u2019t know exactly about what the relationship with the third Beatrice.\n\n* **The Sin of Battler**\n\nIn episode 4 Beato talks about a sin that Battler committed that make Beato to kill everyone, but she already said in red that Battler never met a person named Beatrice before 1986, In episode 3 Shannon mentions that Battler was in love with her and he said this to her.\n\n&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll be back, &lt;see you again&gt; i\u2019ll come for you riding a white horse\u201d\n\nMy theory is that the sin of Battler would be forgetting about this and never coming back until 1986, of course I'm assuming that Shannon returned Battler\u2019s feelings during that time.\n\nNow that I mentioned my theories from previous chapters, i\u2019ll go to the theories of this chapter.\n\n**The baby and the man from 19 years ago**\n\n19 years ago Kinzo gives a Natsuhi a baby to make him pass as her son and be the successor, Natsuhi is told the baby was an orphan from the fukuin house, but i don\u2019t really think Kinzo would just take an orphan and make him an Ushiromiya, so my theory is that the baby is actually related to Kinzo in some way, i already said that Kinzo had a daughter with Beatrice, though i don\u2019t figure how they can be related, It wasn\u2019t specified if this occurs before or after the second Beatrice dies or if the first was alive during that time.\n\nAs for the man's identity, assuming that he\u2019s indeed one of the 17 persons on the island, I think it has to be indeed Battler, but I don't think he is the baby from 19 years ago, Battler is 18 years old a year younger than what the baby should be and theres no one else who could fit as the man on the phone, Jessica is a girl, George is like 20-21, the only choice left is Shannon\/Kanon, but i think Shannon is the original personality since everyone know her since childhood, and Battler didn\u2019t know Kanon, so i guess she\u2019s a girl.\n\n**Twilight victims numbers**\n\nWhen the characters discuss the epitaph Battler and Erika said that the answer has to be a word with 13 or 11 characters because of the thing with the second twilight meaning either remove or separate the two characters. But this made me think, the previous chapters were revolving around the idea of being 13 victims, but what if there are only 11 victims? Kinzo was already dead, and my theories are about Shannon and Kanon being the same person and killing everyone pretending she\u2019s dead, so I counted the victims of the previous chapters without counting Kinzo, Shannon and Kanon.\n\nExample (Counting Kinzo, Shannon and Kanon) :\n\n1)Rudolf\n\n2)Kyrie\n\n3)Shannon\n\n4)Gohda\n\n5)Rosa\n\n6)Krauss\n\n7)Eva\n\n8)Hideyoshi\n\n9)Kinzo\n\n10)Kanon\n\n11)Nanjo\n\n12)Genji\n\n13)Kumasawa\n\nEven after the murders were completed Natsuhi was still killed, it wasn\u2019t necessary but excluding Kinzo Shannon and Kanon:\n\n1)Rudolf\n\n2)Kyrie\n\n3)Gohda\n\n4)Rosa\n\n5)Krauss\n\n6)Eva\n\n7)Hideyoshi\n\n8)Nanjo\n\n9)Genji\n\n10)Kumasawa\n\n11)Natsuhi\n\nThe numbers fit, I don't know if this is actually a hint or just a coincidence.\n\n**The letter of Beatrice**\n\nThe parents, Battler and Shannon\/Kanon, affirms that someone knocks the door and left a letter with the head ring of Kinzo on it, but this is impossible\n\n&gt;*Krauss, Natsuhi and Genji did not even touch that letter*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Not a single person in the dining hall...no, there's a simpler way to say it. Among all those inside the mansion at 24:00, not a single person placed that letter in the corridor.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*None of the characters misidentified a knocking sound.*\n\nMy theory is that there wasn\u2019t even a knock, later Natsuhi affirms that Kanon and Shannon clean Kinzo\u2019s room every time, so i think they could take the ring and then give it to Battler after he resolved the epitaph, The story of the knocking was just an excuse, this could be possible since Battler is not a reliable narrator in this case.\n\n**First Twilight**\n\nGeorge, Jessica, Rosa, Maria and Genji (and Krauss i guess) got killed by the night of the 4th, supposedly before Battler was sleeping.\n\nBut it was already explained that no one except Natsuhi, assuming that she didn\u2019t, and using Battler\u2019s blue truths and Lambda red truths:\n\n&gt;***It's only possible for the crime to have taken place between 24:00 and 1:00!! During that one hour, you were in the dining hall of the mansion!! Therefore, it was impossible for you to commit the crime!\" It has not been specified that the time of death was between 24:00 and 1:00. Therefore, it's possible that the crime didn't occur between 24:00 and 1:00...!***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***...The death proclamation was made at 24:00 on the second day...in other words, at the end of the game. That does not deny the possibility that the murder occurred after the morning of the second day, after the so-called \\`discovery of the crime'...!***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Anyone looking at George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, or Genji's corpses could confirm at a glance that they are dead.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***At a glance, anyone could confirm that these corpses are dead, so it's absolutely impossible that they are just playing dead.***\n\nMy theory is that indeed the victims weren\u2019t playing dead neither they were dead, it was an act made by everyone excluding of course Natsuhi and Erika, Erika since she\u2019s obsessed with solving the crime and framing Natsuhi, and Natsuhi because by all her actions doesn\u2019t seem to be part of it.\n\nErika never gets to see the corpses, by the time she gets there they were already covered in blankets and they disappeared.\n\nThis also explains why the murders were made differently without properly following the epitaph and the blood circle was done horribly.\n\nas to whats the reason to do this, i don\u2019t know yet.\n\nLater as said red the victims would die but because of the bomb i already mentioned.\n\n**Second Twilight**\n\nHideyoshi is killed and the only witness is Natsuhi, but there\u2019s a problem again Neither Natsuhi or Erika see his corpse, Erika was somewhere else and Natsuhi couldn\u2019t see the \u201ckiller\u201d again this could be an act made by hideyoshi to trick Natsuhi and Erika into thinking he was killed.\n\n**The culprit and accomplice**\n\nI believe that in all the chapters the chapters so far the culprit (Shannon) have a different accomplice\n\n**Chapter 1:George**\n\n**Chapter 2:Rosa**\n\n**Chapter 3:Eva**\n\nChapter 4:Everyone that says that witches are real to Battler.\n\nSo i don\u2019t think this chapter is different. and i believe that the accomplice in this case is no one but **Battler.**\n\nLet me explain:\n\n\\-As i said Battler was in love with Shannon but since distances from the family he never gets to see her again, but let\u2019s say that by some coincidence Battler and Shannon get to see each other again, and eventually Battler gets to know and because he is still in love with Shannon, he accepts being her accomplice.\n\n\\-The whole thing about the man from 19 years ago was a part of the plan to use Natsuhi as a scapegoat, Shannon is the only one that knew Natsuhi favorite season and as a servant it wouldn\u2019t be strange if someone told her about the baby, and Battler was the one who make the call, by the time of the first call Natsuhi hadn\u2019t seen Battler since he\u2019s 12 so she wouldn't recognize his voice.\n\n\\-But still Battler loves his family and he doesn\u2019t want to kill them, he knew that if he solves the epitaph the murders could be avoided, it stranges that Battler wanted to solve the riddle in this chapter, since he never showed interest in doing it, and he also declared that he didn\u2019t wanted to cause a fight over the inheritance.\n\nOther things that make me believe this theory are the next.\n\nThis chapter is the only one so far that doesn't mention the relationship between Shannon and George.\n\n* When Battler is the narrator on the board, whenever Shannon\/Kanon appears, they are always together, they never separate in front of Battler, contrary to the previous episode, where they are always in different places. This could be explained because Battler knows the truth about them.",

I feel like I shouldn't have read the magic ending because it left a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nDoes the manga end ways differently?\nIs this truly the end?\n\nI guess they weren't lying that this wouldn't have a happy ending and ironic because I'm a big fan of tragic endings like with the Nier series, and yet this one actually kinda hurt.\ud83d\ude05",

They usually are very limited! \n\nI payed a bunch for it, and I still gotta pay an artist to paint and assemble it, cus I\u2019m scared to ruin it. The third photo is how she\u2019s supposed to look when finished. If any of y\u2019all know any good GK artists (EU preferably) - pls tell me. All artists I was interested won\u2019t open they comms any soon ;-;\n\nSo, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the post. I\u2019m going to post her once more when she\u2019ll be assembled.

I loved that for the moment Eva put her petty shit aside and did all she could along Natsumi to protect the kids from seeing the disgusting sight.\n\nThe Golden Slaughter ost is the cherry on top and carries the scene.

        "selftext":"&gt;!In episode 2, We are given the following red truth in Chapter 16, after twilights 4-6 happen:  Natsuhi's room was exactly the same, just like usual. The door and the windows were locked from the inside. There were\u00a0no fraud or tricks,\u00a0no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide. Natsuhi's own key was in George's pocket, and the inside of the room was sealed off. Only the five master keys were left, and 'Rosa' was holding all of them. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!My question is, why is 'Rosa' in single quotes here? In the other translation (forgot the name, the one used in the PS3 port), I think it even uses \"Rosa\" (double quotation marks). During my readings, this genuinely made me think that someone was pretending to be Rosa, and it even fit into some theories I made before EP 6. After finishing the entire story, I still don't understand why this was written this way.!&lt;",

I remember my feelings when first reading this and am very conflicted.\n\nI very much wasn't liking half of the characters, in a good way tho.\nBattler is entertaining in a similar way Keiichi was, Jessica gives heavy Mion energy, Maria altho pretty annoying is just a cute energetic kid, George.. don't know how I felt about him. Shanon and Kanon.. I just feel bad for them. The discrimination and prejudice of the powerful looking down on the weak is so hard to watch sometimes.\n\nThe drama among the adults tho, honestly is the most interesting part so far. \nThe kids, altho wholesome, just didn't spark any interest within me. Its just generic slice of life antics that I've seen many times before. However their childish innocence did make for a great contrast to the snobby mean spirited adults.\n\nThe business talk and exposition of the political situation of the era was so interesting. I don't remember how it goes further down the line, but \n\n#####Some minor spoilers to Higurashi\n\nRyukishi definitely improved with his political exposition. No offence but the political stuff was just so heavy handed and booring in Higurashi. As of right now, I'm glad that Ryukishi is keeping the political elements focused and relevant to the plot. That was something I didn't like about Higurashi's political exposition. I applaud and respect Ryukishi for all the attention to detail on the political gameboard of the world of Hinamizawa, but almost half of it didn't even feel relevant to Takano and how she fits into it. It was just alot of fat that could've been cut.\n\nAnyway.. back to Umineko lol\n\nI forgot how savage Eva was to Natsuhi. Man I always remembered how much I felt bad for Natsuhi and Rosa among the adults. When Eva blew up on Natsuhi, I felt that. Gardamn her VA is soo good. She was fantastic as Takano and continued to impress me with Eva. She's just perfect at expressing such venomous energy in her voice.\n\nAnd that's where I'm at so far \ud83d\ude01",

        "title":"Milf Wars (Analysis on which adult ushiromiya is the best milf)",
        "selftext":"The contenders for ultimate milf from the game Umineko. We have:\n\nRosa\n\nAsumu\n\nKyrie \n\nNatsuhi\n\nEva\n\n-----\nREQUIREMENTS FOR BEING A MILF (IN MY OPINION, NO YOU CANNOT CHANGE MY MIND)\n\n1) Being a mother whether related or not. Found family milfs are fine but most of the milf-y aspects come from the weird \"big tiddies because she had babies\" mentality. That being said, that's not a requirement for milf-ism, but big booba milfs are part of the milf attraction. I mean let's be honest, genuine milf simps are horny and have mommy issues, ANYWAY big tiddies are a requirement in this regard.\n\n2) Having immaculate girlboss energy. Milfs are not failwives, or simps for pathetic men\/significant other. Milfs have POWER, they have CONFIDENCE, and most importantly their s\/o respects them. A real proper milf isn't a doormat. \n\n3) A milf must have some sort of maternal or motherly love for their child that is consistent and pure. \n\n-----\n\nReasons why Rosa fails at being the ultimate milf; she does not pass any requirements. That woman does not have big boobas for a start and what she's wearing doesn't help in the slightest.\n\nOnto the second requirement:\n\nNot only is Rosa constantly roped in by her siblings, bullied by them as much as possible, but has not once found her own identity or sense of self worth. She has zero confidence in herself, and thus the first man she fell in love with, she eloped, and paid for his highly expensive \"trip\" to which he never returned. Not only did she cling to the first guy that was nice to her (from what the novel implies), she was impregnated and since this was during 1986 JAPAN, she socially ruined her reputation and standing by becoming a single mother. A true girlboss, especially one that was raised in the 1% upper class, would be fully aware of the cultural and social standards at the time. \n\nNow this goes onto the last requirement: love.\n\nDoes Rosa love Maria consistently? No.\n\nDue to the choices ROSA made as a grown woman, Maria was born and thus inexplicably blamed for why Rosa's social standing fell both in the ushiromiya family, and in her work, which by the way, she wasn't really focusing on either. It is expressed both in anime, manga and visual novels that Rosa leaves Maria, a 9 year old (who is autistically coded) completely on her own for days at a time, to elope with other men in a desperate attempt to satisfy her lack of self worth and gain a temporary sense of being loved... when Maria is RIGHT THERE. Rosa is the one that Maria treasures the most, her literal wish for the golden land was for her mother to love her. Not to mention Rosa physically abuses Maria in public, in the home, and destroys Maria's toys. Not just any toys, specifically Sakutarou and one of her porcelain rabbits. For all the umineko readers out there, I'm going to assume that we all know JUST how much that mentally scarred Maria. \n\nIt's ironic that Rosa who blames Maria for her failings in social standing and respect from those around her, is the one actually fully responsible for it. \n\nIn conclusion, she is not a milf. TECHNICALLY she is one, but in spirit? In essence? Rosa is completely unfit for ultimate milf status.\n\nRating: 0\/3\n-----\nNow onto Asumu\n\nShe fails in the first requirement because 1) she never had a game sprite and 2) the only images we get of her are vague flash backs which, to me, she's not big tiddy milfy. Personally itty bitty titty milfs are valid but in the case of this specific guidelines where the first rule is based on traditional milf, I'm sorry to say but she doesn't pass.\n\nAs for the second requirement, not much is actually gleaned aside from \"She was able to heal Rudolph's pain and understand him in ways other women could not.\" Aside from that she was just a wife, there's no information or references (except from kyrie's questionable bias) to suggest that she had other aspirations, goals, or general girl-bossery. Also SPOILERS  she's dead. All she's known for is being that trope of \"kind wife that takes care of a piece of human garbage but it's OK because they love eachother\" and then she's fridged.  She was doomed from the narrative to be The Dead Wife\n\nAs for the third, she actually succeeds! It is constantly referenced, and part of a big reason for how the whole story plays out due to how much love Battler received from his mother. As far as we know, she was consistent, and Battler became a fairly decent human being despite being surrounded by the most toxic people you'll ever meet. He loved his mother so much he hit da bricks once Rudolph immediately remarried...  \n\n0.5\/3 she served only plot relevance and wasn't a character, she loved Battler because it was important for the story.\n-----\nKyrie\n\nKyrie succeeds in the first requirement. Her sprites, manga drawings and official arts have her with a nice pair of boobies. It's consistent. She has milf boobs.\n\nShe fails completely in the second requirement. And this may come as a shock to anyone who has read this far, but kyrie is not the girlboss you think she is. She's actually just a huge jealous loser that copes by \"turning the chess board\" and offering insight to a group of greedy in-laws that are mostly too obsessed with themselves to actually do any introspection-- so to the reader and the ushiromiya's she sounds smart, distant, like some wise out of the box type thinker. Now we go onto the second stage of why she completely fails at being a girlboss. Of having confidence and power. I mean sure, she wanted out of her own family bullshit and the best means to do that was to marry into a richer family and hit da bricks, but the issue is that she chose Rudolph who was eloping with her and asumu AT THE SAME TIME to the point they gave birth on the same day. A real girlboss would not have stood for that, or even blamed the other woman who was technically more of Rudolph's actual love interest than her. A confident woman would have left him high and dry but no... she didn't. Instead. She waited for Asumu to die, and then has the audacity to say to the demon of envy that she's far more envious due to the fact she waited for 18 years for a cheating man to come marry her. Now to be fair ryukishi07 nuked Leviathan by only having her envy last 7 days and 7 nights, just so that kyrie could have her pseudo girlboss move which when you look at it, is incredibly pathetic. Move on jesus christ. 18 years of seething over another woman??? Zero fucking girlboss energy there. \n\nAs for the third requirement, she's a mother, and from what we understand, she was consistently kind to Ange but then you gotta think about how Ange-Beatrice's only goal was to bring back her alleged half brother Battler, and not her mother. So uh, maybe have a think on that one.\n\nRating: 1.3\/ 3\n-----\nNow onto the poor wreck that is Natsuhi\n\nShe completely passes the first and easiest requirement. That woman should be proud of her chest and Krauss does not deserve her nor any part of her body.\n\nWhich brings us to the second requirement: total failure. I will give her credit, she's completely disenfranchised from the get go. Not only was she forced to marry the pure idiocy that is Krauss, but the adult side of the family (particularly eva) do not in any way respect her. Her husband doesn't even defend her, preferring to send her away so she can weep from humiliation out of sight. Ironically she's smarter than Krauss, Rosa and Rudolph, better at money and stocks, and actually running things, but because she is a woman in Japan 1986, in a family comprised of traumatised leeches who feed off money and misery, her inner girlbossery is completely stunted. She fails due to circumstance, but also, she married for her family so that they may survive, therefore in a way, by shouldering that burden and suffering the consequences of that for years, just expresses that she has better inner strength than let's say, Rosa and Kyrie. Too bad she has no allies and no team on her side. She loses points for bullying the servants. You know, the ones that live there and work for you, are treated like invisible furniture. Maybe if she wasn't so wrapped up in her suffocation, she could've formed bonds with the servants and gained upper hand through such means... alas. A fail is still a fail, even if circumstance is involved.\n\nNext onto the last one: Love\n\nDoes Natsuhi love Jessica? Yes\n\nDoes Natsuhi consistently love Jessica? Yes but in an unhealthy way.\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that Natsuhi would do anything for Jessica... except something that would make either of them,  or the Ushiromiya family by extension lose face. It's to the point that Jessica hides her actual interests from her own mother and most of the time they're together, Natsuhi is criticising Jessica on relatively minor things because unlike Jessica, Natsuhi doesn't have the societal power or freedom that her daughter has. She intentionally or not, is inflicting the same type of snobbishness and societal pressures that led her to be forced to marry Krauss. She's actually continuing the cycle of misogyny by desperately attempting to get Jessica to conform rather than to let her set her own path. It doesn't help that Jessica is the known Ushiromiya successor, but perhaps maybe instead of molding Jessica into what Natsuhi wishes she could've been, she could have taught her the ways of the girlboss that she was denied. If Jessica became the head of the Ushiromiya family, with a Natsuhi who taught her the realities of being a woman, and of how to maintain her confidence and power as an exceptionally privileged woman, then maybe in a kakera where the rokkenjima massacre didn't happen, Jessica could've been a force to be reckoned with. Natsuhi loses points purely because she projects onto Jessica without actually letting her daughter enjoy the things that make her happy. It doesn't need to be a public thing (given I've talked about societal and familial expectations)  but I think a healthy parent and child relationship shouldn't be one where the child has to hide core parts of their interests to avoid the wrath of their parent if they are discovered.\n\n1.5\/3\n-----\nNow onto our final contestant, the baddest,  meanest bitch you'll ever meet, Eva Ushiromiya. \n\nShe passes the first requirement. Her original sprite had massive honkers, her manga counterpart even bigger. As for the sprites beyond the OG they deboobed her. At least until the steam sprites came out, and somehow they're even bigger but it looks like she's not wearing a supportive bra at all, and the steam sprites really dialled up the sexiness so... I'm not going to take that version into account. Same goes for the other ladies talked about above. With that said, Eva has the biggest boobs out of all the contenders.\n\nOnto the second requirement\n\nEva is the literal epitome of girlboss. Brought up in an incredibly misogynistic and abusive household, Eva did not become meek, she became determined. And while yes her reasoning is for male approval (kinzo may you rest in acid and maggots), that doesn't mean she didn't get shit done. Kinzo wouldn't let her go to university, even threatening to disinherit her, but she stood her ground, and credit where credit is due, Krauss stepped in for her cause. Either way, she got into university, and that actually paved the way for Rosa to be able to go. Talk about being the one to set an option that originally wasn't possible, Krauss in this case gets some credit as well. He DID use his male privilege to help out his sister, but that didn't mean that Eva didn't fight tooth and nail for her right to university. Then, we move onto Hideyoshi. Out of all the spouses in the adult circle, Hideyoshi is the only fucking normal one there, but he's not a doormat and neither (obviously) is Eva. Hideyoshi is so far the only one to reign in Eva when she's cruelly exerting her power over others (like Natsuhi) and Eva not only respects his suggestions, she listens to them. That sings to me of a mutual love and understanding only a girlboss is capable of. It's not one where she feels obligated to obey, rather that she values and respects what her husband has to say. And in turn, her husband is ride or die. In some episodes of umineko, he more than happily covers for Eva when she's getting her comeuppance from her shitty family through violent means. (I DONT CONDONE MURDER OF CHILDREN. THE USHIROMIYA ADULTS ARE FREE GAME)\n\nMost importantly, Eva is CONFIDENT. She knows her value, her worth and skill, to the point where she understood from the get go that even though she's a woman in a man's world, she can still find ways to play their game and usurp. A true girlboss knows how to navigate the world that she is placed in and the rules that she has to abide (at least socially) and Eva does that perfectly... even if it means asserting dominance over the kicked puppy that is Natsuhi. However to be fair she does this to everyone, but unfortunately since Eva is playing the game of Men, there can be no room for women allies for they lack power. Eva herself lacks direct power too, but as said before, she finds her ways even if they are morally corrupt and malicious. Cycle of abuse yada yada, buncha traumatised family members seeing how much they can traumatise eachother more, for funsies I guess.\n\nFor the last requirement: Love\n\nDoes Eva love George? Yes\n\nDoes Eva love George consistently? Yes but in the only ways she knows how to give him the freedom that he has as a man. It is similar to natsuhi and Jessica, but I'd say that this dynamic is even more intense because of George's gender. Eva originally conceived George and was elated he was a male because according to the rules of the men she has been forced to follow for her entire life, a first born SON is the perfect candidate for successor. So what does she do? Prepare him for that role as best as she can. One can argue that she's using George to fulfil her own dreams of being head of the family, but when you see how invested she is in his development, how his death utterly destroys her completely, one cannot deny that there is love. For us normal people, we can express love by giving freedom, by valuing happiness over wealth, for the 1% upper class, there is no room for that. It's not even present in the culture. Eva, who has never experienced love outside of Hideyoshi and has constantly been reminded that even though she is of pseudo royalty, her gender decides her rights (or lack of them) the birth of George gives her hope and love. This child will never experience extreme prejudice because of his gender and thus... she gives EVERYTHING to prepare him for his future. Her way of showing love is by providing all the skills, knowledge and opportunities her wealth can afford. George becomes incredibly well read, skilled at musical instruments, languages, you name it. He grows into a fairly established man... practicality wise. You'd think that Eva's sheer confidence and presence would evoke some sort of respect towards women, or that the father figure, Hideyoshi, completely respects her as well would make George less of a jealous incel and more of a man but alas. In loving George in the only way she knew how, she didn't pass down the value of the sheer privilege he was afforded. You could say that Eva's helicopter parenting, though done out of love, actually just made George another cog in the machine called misogyny.\n \n\nDespite the complications of the last requirement, it is clear both through the novels, manga and anime, that Eva prizes George over her own life. Over everyone else. If George defied her (by marrying shannon) she wouldn't disinherit him. Of course as shown she'd be pissed as fuck but that doesn't mean her love was conditional from the very start. Unlike you know... kinzo. Rosa. \n\nI also want to add that Eva regrets her decision to throw George into the war of succession over her rivalry with Krauss. She genuinely expresses regret rather than some backwards cope argument that most of the adults do regarding their behaviours and children. No extra points, just further clarification on how Eva despite it all, was able to at least realise that her helicopter parenting style was wrong. \n\nI have taken some points away because when you look at natsuhi\/Jessica vs Eva\/George, the two mothers are indeed pushing their own aspirations onto their children. I would say that the only difference is that George is able to (eventually) come clean to his mother and beyond the initial insult at him marrying a servant, Eva was actually more upset that he didn't feel comfortable enough to be honest with her in the first place.\n\nThe case with Natsuhi\/Jessica is different. I really don't see an outcome where Natsuhi would be able to accept Jessica's non-conformitist behaviour and interests. Now mind you, Jessica DOES bear the weight of being the heir whereas George doesn't, so that unfortunately only confirms my belief that Natsuhi would pressure Jessica into conforming and giving up her dreams. I don't see Krauss being supportive of Jessica either unfortunately.\n\nWith that being said, Eva Ushiromiya scores the highest of 2.8\/3\n\nShe's the ultimate milf out of the Umineko franchise",

It's not what i thought actually i was under the impression form the beginning that Beatrice 'exists' and i didn't pay much attention to those use of 'make up' and exists in single quotes. I noticed the exists probably have a deeper meaning after playing the tea party section. It makes you question if she really exists only in the post game and we see Beatrice only in the postgame which isn't part of main story.\n\nHere's how i think it could work and multiple people may be involved but there are a few things i have noticed about Gengi.\n\nHe said telephone is not working but at the end with maria he was probably the one who called them and killed himself(on Kinzo's order) thus one of the death is fake(the grandfather's death was fake). Why do i think that?\n\nBecause remember there were 13 sacrifices required but 14 died and the last one(natsuhi's death) was in the head meaning \"gouge the head and kill\"(fourth Twilight)which was what we assumed was for grandfather's death. There is probably more twists on that but i also noticed one more thing with Gengi\n\nRemember kanon and Gengi went to see eva and hideyoshi when they were dead \nGengi went to call natsuhi and kanon went for weapon he took more than 5 five minutes and it was even mentioned but yet Gengi arrived after kanon i mean the mansion palor and eva's room couldn't be that far, right? And Gengi might be the one drawing magic circle on the door in the time when kanon was searching a weapon but i know very well this could be a normal lack of thought by author or just the manson is very very gigantic \n\nAnyways these are some things i caught and personally i don't like the idea of it being a 19th person or one of the eighteen i want BEATRICE to show up!!!!! Plz Show me your slime that i saw in the opening (ps4) once again!!! BEATRICE.......!!!!! BEATRICE.......!!!!!",

        "title":"Finished Ep. 6. Ideas and Theories *SPOILERS UP TO 6*",
        "selftext":"&gt;!Holy shit..... This episode is definitely my favorite or second favorite. The last portion was so heavily concentrated with facts and hints that I had to stop and think for like an hour afterwards looking over the red truths and the events that were shown. I had stopped after episode 5 to reread the entire thing, so I came in with some theories. I was not expecting this though...I had to think about the metaphorical aspect of why they constantly said that only one of the lovers could succeed, and how furniture isn't a full human but rather a 'fractured soul'. I think the moment of epiphany hit when I remembered the fact that in games 2 and 4 Kanon's corpse was 'erased', and it all hit me like a truck.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!My main theory (if you can even call it that after seeing that lol) is that Kanon and Shannon are the same person. This was strengthened even more by the 'final duel' in the episode where the bomb is dropped that even if Erika joins them, it only makes 17 humans total. This can either be interpreted as Erika not counting as a human (highly unlikely) or that one of the humans is playing the role of two. I then started thinking about how Kanon could have possibly saved Battler, and I realized. Shannon was in the other room where the window tape was never confirmed to be intact, and she had left, \"turned\" into Kanon (I still have some trouble understanding what constitutes this change), switched spots with Battler, and \"turned\" back into Shannon. I had an idea after replaying that one of the people was pretending to be someone else, but this was a whole nother level lol. Now, knowing this piece of info, I'm going to have to relook at certain scenes but I also feel it's highly likely that Kanon\/Shannon is the culprit as well. There are some hurdles with this theory, primarily the fact that Kanon is confirmed to be dead in episode 2 in the second twilight, and episode 4, where Kanon is also confirmed dead, and the 9th victim at that. Considering the fact that those two instances were the ones where the corpse was erased though, I have a feeling that it can be explained. My current theory is that Kanon\/Shannon was one person throughout all of the games, and they had access to a 'corpse' Shannon. (A Shannon body double). I feel like this could explain most murders easily, although I've yet to take one final review, so I could be wrong. I recall in ep. 1, Beatrice makes it clear that she \"guarantees the identities of all unidentified corpses\", and considering Shannon and Krauss both only had half of their head smashed, they (probably?) wouldn't count as \"unidentified\". After all, I'm pretty sure Battler sees Kanon in the shed after G1\/T1, and then sees his \"dead\" corpse in the boiler room later on. It wouldn't make sense that Kanon and Shannon share a body yet can be in the same room at the same time, and for Battler to see Kanon's corpse and not notice half of his head gone. Once again, I could be totally wrong, but after Beatrice got absorbed into Shannon and she talked to \"mother\" and it showed the scene of young Battler on the beach talking about his ideal lady, I feel like there is only one person that he could be speaking to at that moment like that, which is Shannon. If true, then Shannon\/Kanon likely is the culprit.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I have yet to figure out Battler's sin, I've been racking my brain over it. I recall in ep. 3, Shannon mentions an embarrassing memory of Battler six years ago, and how he said something corny like \"I'll be back, &lt;see you again&gt;\". I don't know if that would necessarily constitute the \"promise\" (I feel like the game makes it pretty clear that Battler promised Beatrice something, and he forgot) however. Speaking about Battler, I was so sure there were 2 Battlers, and that's how he could break out of the room. Of course, only one Battler is present on the island at any given time, but I was thinking the wordplay could be that the binding red truths that referred to \"Battler\" were not our Battler. I still believe there are two Battlers due to the fact that the red explicitly tells us that \"Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu\", \"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born\", \"My name is Ushiromiya Battler\" and \"You (Us Battler) are not Ushiromiya Asumu's son\". These red truths make me think that there has to be two Battlers, and they switched places around those six years. I have a final theory regarding how Kyrie and Asumu had the same delivery date, and how Kyrie states that she wasn't as lucky (had a stillborn son). I'm guessing that Us Battler (Don't know what else to call him lol) is actually that son, since Battler is all but confirmed to be Kinzo's grandson still even though he isn't Asumu's son (as long as he's Rudolf's son, but this was also just a blue truth that Beatrice didn't cut down), and he was taken from Kyrie (she was unaware), and given to Natsuhi by Kinzo to \"raise as my grandson\". Now, this actually final part is a true throw in the dark, but I caught something suspicious in episode 3 when Battler asks Ronove for the confirmation of death for Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie, and he states that he cannot due to the fact that he wants Battler to accept Beatrice as his opponent again, and this entire plot point is forgotten by Battler due to that whole conversation after. Considering Rudolf had a stake in his head, and I doubt Eva would ever kill Hideyoshi, those two probably took eachother out (Rudolph at least probably killed Hideyoshi) I think that the person who killed Nanjo was Kyrie. After all, even the tips for her corpse it states that the stomach isn't an instant death wound, and if Nanjo, the family doctor, was involved with the births of Kyrie and Asumu, and Kyrie found out that she was lied to about her stillborn son, she would kill him. If she also did write the 07151129, perhaps Nov. 29 is the date that Natsuhi pushed the servant and Battler off. Again, this is the most wobbly part of anything I've wrote about, but it's something that could be plausible.!&lt;\n\nI'm not really looking for spoilers, just wanted to share my thoughts as I know I'm personally interested in what other people are thinking while playing mystery VN's at certain parts. My only question would be, should I go directly into CH. 7? or is it worth taking one final skim through the series with this new knowledge?",

I am also interested in Higurashi, but I don't know too much about it (same as about Umeniko) or if it is related in any way with Umineko.\n\nI think that most of the people agree that the VN is the best way to consume the story. The thing is I am more of a manga reader that enjoys reading fast, so this is what I would like to do, to read the manga, but I am not sure if I will do this I can finish both stories and have a good, satisfactory experience.",

        "title":"I am trying to solve Books 1-5. I've hit a wall and I don't know how to move forward. (Spoiler for Books 1-5)",
        "selftext":"I finished Book 5 towards the end of 2022, and I've been going back and forth about continuing to Book 6. Half of me wants to keep reading because I've been enjoying the story so far, and the other half of me doesn't want to move forward until I have more confidence in my theory, especially since theoretically I should be able to figure everything out by now. Here is what I have so far:\n\n\n**Book 1, First Twilight**\n\n\nDuring the investigation of the First Twilight, the only room in which bloodstains were discovered was the dining room. Via Knox\u2019s 8th, It can be assumed that if there were additional bloodstains that resulted from those murders, then somebody would have found them. Therefore, all of the murders of the First Twilight must have taken place inside the dining room. There is a big problem with this conclusion, as there is no justification for Shannon to have been in the dining room at any point during that night. She had been told by Genji that Krauss had ordered her to switch her schedule and work in the guesthouse instead that night. Also, while making her nightly rounds in the mansion, Shannon made it a point to avoid being noticed by anybody in the dining room at all costs. If Krauss really did move the schedules, and if the dining room is the only murder scene, then I can't figure out how she was murdered that night. The only conclusion that I can come to from this is that Shannon is the culprit (at least for Book 1).\nShannon, while pretending to be Beatrice, approaches Maria while she is searching for her rose. She gives her the umbrella, the letter, and the key to the shed. She then tells Maria to lock the shed door at a specified time at night and hide the key. Later that night, Shannon ambushes Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, and Rosa while Gohda is serving tea. After the murders she moves all of the bodies to the shed and applies makeup to make her face appear to be smashed. She then shut the door and moved into position to play dead. Maria, following the instructions in the letter, then comes to the shed, paints the magic circle on the door, and locks it. Afterwards she hides the key somewhere for Kanon to find it the next morning. After returning to the mansion to gather everyone, he pretends to grab the key from the servant room before leading everyone to the shed. \nThe biggest problem with this theory is the extra padlock that was added to the shed door after the survivors finished their investigation. As far as I know, there is only one key to this second padlock ,and Natsuhi had it the entire time. I suppose this could be explained away by saying that Genji used sleight-of-hand to switch the key with a different key before handing it over to Natsuhi, but this seems a little weak to me. Beatrice's Red Truth at the end of Book 4 regarding the corpses is not a problem here because she only confirmed the identities of the unidentified bodies. Shannon's body was clearly identified, so that Red Truth does not apply to her. \n\n\n**Second Twilight**\n\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. Shannon hid inside the guest room before Eva and Hideyoshi left the parlor. This is the exact room in which they would stay every year before the guesthouse was built, so Shannon would know which room to go to. After committing the murders, Shannon slid the letter underneath the door and hid again inside the room. Once Kanon and Genji left to get help, Shannon opened the door from the inside, painted the magic circle, and hid again before Kanon got back to the room.\n\n\n**Fourth, Fifth Twilights**\n\n\nShannon knows that Kinzo is dead, and would presumably have access to his corpse; therefore, she would have the ability to make Kinzo\u2019s corpse appear in the boiler room.\nRegarding the Red Truths related to this Twilight, Shannon is neither dead nor a survivor. Assuming that the culprit and \u201cBeatrice\u201d are the same person, Shannon would know about the underground tunnel system because (I think) that is where the gold is hidden. If that tunnel system extends beyond the island, then there are still no problems with Shannon being the culprit.\n\n\n**Sixth, Seventh, Eighth Twilights**\n\nThis one seems extremely straightforward. Shannon has a master key, so getting into the locked parlor is not a problem. Maria would simply relock the parlor door from the inside once Shannon left.\n\n\n\n**Book 2, First Twilight**\n\n\nAt some point before the family conference somebody, either Shannon or an accomplice, unlocked the door to the chapel. They knew that no one would know that it was unlocked due to the forbidden nature of the building. Shannon, disguised as Beatrice, then handed the key and envelope to Maria. She also gives Rosa a letter to recruit her to the plan. Later that night, Shannon led all the adults to the chapel. She then presented the three gold bars to them as proof that she really is Beatrice, and a witch. After everyone accepted that she is \"Beatrice\", she murdered the six victims of the First Twilight. At some point after that, Maria opened her envelope, took the chapel key, and locked the door.\n\n\n**Second Twilight**\n\n\nNo issues with Shannon being the culprit here. She unlocked the door to Jessica\u2019s room with her own master key and killed Jessica and Kanon. She then took Kanon\u2019s key and hid it in Jessica\u2019s pocket. Afterwards, she took Kanon\u2019s body with her and left the room, locking the door with her own master key.\n\n\n**Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth Twilights**\n\n\nShannon killed Kumasawa and Nanjo in the servant room with the help of Genji, then hid the corpses. Nobody mistook somebody else for Kanon in the servant room because Kanon was never there to begin with; he was already dead after the Second Twilight. \n\nAfterwards, Shannon, Gohda, and George left for the chapel without Genji. Genji then followed them there so that Shannon would have an excuse to lead everybody to Natsuhi\u2019s room. Once there, she killed George and Gohda and then applied makeup to pretend to be dead as well. While making his nightly rounds, Genji painted the door to Natsuhi\u2019s room. He then brought Maria, Rosa, and Battler to Natsuhi\u2019s room. Rosa, knowing that Shannon is playing dead, grabbed Batter as he was examining her body so that he wouldn\u2019t be able to discover the truth.\n\n\n**Book 3, First, Second Twilight**\n\nUp until this point I was extremely confident in my Shannon theory. However, with all of the servant's deaths confirmed during the First Twilight, and with Rosa's and Maria's deaths confirmed during the Second Twilight, it seems that my theory has completely fallen apart. Is there some semantic loophole that I'm just not seeing to get around the First Twilight in Book 3, or was my theory flawed from the very beginning? \n\nIf Shannon is the true culprit, then the entirety of Book 3 makes absolutely no sense to me. If Shannon is not the true culprit, then the entirety of Book 1 makes no sense and I'm going to have to start over. I'm confused and not really sure what to do from here.",

I know that its not finished as it supposedly ended before reaching the answers arcs.. but is it a decent watch on its own?\n\nI guess this post is for the anime onlies.. so what did y'all think of the anime?

How could Beatrice kill people when she doesn't exist in her physical form?  \n2. Why did Rudolf predict that he was going to be killed even though he didn't believe in the supernatural?  \n3. Am I right in thinking that Battler believes in the existence of magic but won't verbalize it because then Beatrice will get more powerful....somehow? and he can't have that because Beatrice will inevitably commit more evil?   \n4. What exactly is the golden land?  \n5. What does Beatrice want? Does she want to sleep? Does she want to kill people? Does she want everybody to believe in her? What does she waaaaant?  \n6.  Bernkastel or whatever her name is (the witch loli) looks so much like Rika from higurashi series. And she also says that she had a human body once. Is there a connection between Rika and Bernkastel? Btw, i have not watched higurashi anime past the first season.   \n7.

        "title":"My Theories (Some are pretty stupid, I know)",
        "selftext":"I've already finished reading everything about a month ago, but I wasn't able to post any theories here because reasons. Here are the theories I came up with, at least the ones that I still remember. I was right about some things and completely wrong about others. Almost all of these theories were devised pretty early, before Knox and Van Dine's rules were clearly established, so they're gonna sound just as ridiculous as Battler's small bombs. Anyway, here they are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Beatrice is Italian** \\- *This one turned out to be correct.* I wouldn't have found this out if it weren't for the voice acting in the Umineko Project version tbh. Anyway, I didn't think much of this at first and just brushed it off as some random little tidbit about Beatrice, and boy was I wrong! I felt really dumb for not being able to connect Beatrice being Italian and meeting Kinzo during WWII to explain where all the gold came from.\n\n*EDIT:* In Italian, Beatrice is pronounced the way it is in the game. Try inputting Beatrice in Google Translate set to Italian and hit the read-aloud button and you'll see what I mean.\n\n**Kumasawa is Kinzo's Mistress** \\- *This one's pretty silly in retrospect.* It all started with the appearance of Virgilia way back at the beginning of Ep. 3. She was first introduced as the original Beatrice and the place where she's first introduced is the Kuwadorian. So I thought that since her original name was Beatrice and she's seen in the Kuwadorian, it's possible that she's Kinzo's mistress. Later on in the episode, just before the battle between Virgilia and Beatrice, Kumasawa turns into Virgilia, implying they're the same person. Seeing as how Kumasawa and Kinzo are both old people, I immediately jumped to the conclusion that Kumasawa is Kinzo's mistress.\n\n*EDIT:* The portrait in the hall can be explained as being a portrait of the daughter who died in that accident and not the mistress Kinzo supposedly has. I mean why dedicate something like that to a person who's still alive, right?\n\n**Kinzo Raped His Own Daughter** \\- *This one turned out to be correct too.* At the beginning of Ep. 3, it's also shown that there's a child (who becomes the Beatrice we know and love) living in the Kuwadorian. At first, I assumed this child to be the Beatrice who fell off the cliff (witnessed by Rosa) later on in the episode, but then I remembered that the child called Kinzo \"grandfather\" or something like that, which means it can't be the fallen Beatrice because she's the daughter, meaning the child is the daughter of the fallen Beatrice. I ruled out Jessica and Maria because Kinzo hates them and would therefore know nothing about the Kuwadorian. Then I thought \"Wait a minute... How was this woman able to have a child when she's kept locked up in this place?\" And then there's Beato's explanation of Kinzo using magic to create a homunculus or whatever, which led me to the conclusion that Kinzo raped the fallen Beatrice. I didn't think it was too far of a stretch since the fallen Beatrice was already locked up against her will, to begin with.\n\n**Kinzo is the Culprit** \\- *I came up with this one before the reveal that Kinzo's been dead all along.* I first suspected Kinzo when his body was discovered in the boiler room. The burnt corpse reminded me a lot of Takano. Him being the culprit would explain a lot of stuff since we don't really get to see his movements very often. Eva's seal on the study door could be explained with secret passages and Kinzo hiding under the bed, but those were later disproven. Half of me rejected this theory because it was too easy of a solution, so I started looking for other potential suspects.\n\n**Prof. Ootsuki is the Culprit** \\- *This one's beyond ridiculous now that I think about it.* I started suspecting the professor during the scene where he was talking to Ange in Ep. 4. He said that Kinzo possessed several rare grimoires, some worth millions. It was also made clear that the guy's obsessed with occult stuff. So I thought \"What if the motive for the murders wasn't the gold or the inheritance, but Kinzo's book collection?\" \"Maybe there's one book in particular that the professor really, really wanted, so he killed everyone.\" Then the professor reacted in a very abnormal way when Ange showed him Maria's diary, which contains writing from the same person who wrote the message bottles. I thought that maybe the person who wrote all those was the professor's accomplice and the professor believed that this person was still alive and was in contact with Ange, which is why he reacted the way he did.\n\n**The Culprit Killed Everyone Without Setting Foot on the Island** \\- *This one's the most ridiculous one of all.* The professor being the culprit breaks the red truth of there being no 19th person on the island. So I thought, maybe the professor never set foot on the island, at least until after everyone's dead. Maybe the professor hired a bunch of professionals similar to the Yamainu and had them snipe at everyone from ships or something. Maybe all the red goat eyes everyone keeps seeing were actually laser sights from snipers. It's never stated in red that the windows are all intact, so it's possible that everyone was shot through the windows. Once everyone's dead, the professor's accomplice delivers him the book but is then betrayed and killed.\n\n**There's a Secret Room\/Passage Behind the Portrait** \\- *Another pretty ridiculous theory.* I once theorized that the underground passage could be accessed through the portrait in the main hall. Why? Just because the portrait looked suspicious. No real reason behind it, just a gut feeling. This would explain how in Ep. 4, everyone was sent to the dungeon in such a short amount of time, assuming Kyrie's mystery K.O. drug existed. At one point, I also theorized there was some sort of security room with monitors all over the place behind the portrait just because of all the scenes with Kinzo watching everyone through a crystal ball. As for who \"Kinzo\" was in Ep. 4, I couldn't really explain that during that point in time.",

        "title":"My Attempt At Solving the 1st Episode's Mysteries, after finishing the 5th Episode",
        "selftext":"Before I begin, PLEASE DON'T SPOIL ME, NO SPOILERS PLEASE!\n\n1st Game:\n\n* **Shannon, Gohda, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss and Rosa are definitely dead** (Lambda\u2019s Red Truth from EP. 4).\n* Anyone who knew about the Storehouse Key (probably only the servants, but maybe Krauss and Natsuhi as well) are definitely suspicious. Especially Kanon and Genji. This is a must to defeat the closed room in the Garden Shed (Storehouse).\n* Nanjo, isn\u2019t suspicious in THIS GAME, but his statement that *his diagnosis can be false* is very interesting.\n* **Kinzo is most certainly dead** (Beatrice\u2019s Red Truth in EP. 4). Therefore, everyone who claims to have met him, and every scene with him in it, is immediately not as it seems.\n* Due to **Knox\u2019s 10th**, we can say for sure that the burnt corpse in the boiler room was indeed Kinzo, who was already dead at the beginning of the Game, thus, the mystery of his disappearance is moot.\n* Maria certainly did not receive the Letter from Beatrice, and the Relatives are not the ones who did it since they were together for the conference. So, once again, the Servants are subtly implicated. Or, Maria is also an accomplice.\n* Due to **Knox\u2019s 1st**, we already know there are no more than 17 Humans on Rokkenjima.\n* *Eva mentions that the culprit\/ culprits must have access to weapons*. Since that certainly seems to be the case, Kinzo\u2019s study seems to be the only place that has guns, which would certainly tie in with most of the murders and the disfigurement of the bodies. Therefore, once again, those who were allowed to enter Kinzo\u2019s room immediately become suspects once again.\n* Eva and Hideoyoshi still have extremely shaky alibies for the 1st twilight, therefore their involvement is still in question.\n* Who would know magic circles well enough to incorporate them into the murders? Maria seems to be the obvious choice, but maybe Genji, Shannon and Kannon might have seen Kinzo mumbling about them when he was still alive?\n* Eva is certainly able to hold her own in a scuffle, so how exactly would she have been killed? A gun seems to be the perfect solution to this problem, and if this hypothesis is true, then the stakes were probably driven into the bullet wound on her and Hideyoshi\u2019s forehead.\n* Based on the Hypothesis that Kanon and\/or Genji is\/are the culprit\/ culprits, Eva and Hideoyoshi\u2019s Closed Room might not have been a closed room in the first place. Everything we saw, from Kanon discovering that the door was locked, to the magic engraving on the door just a few moments after Kanon goes to get something to cut the chain with, might be completely false since Battler was not present at this scene. This theory is also further strengthened by the fact that Beatrice never mentions in Red as to whether the murders were certainly closed room murders.\n* The entire scene where Kanon is dealt a critical injury might also be completely fake. It is unknown whether Kumasawa is an accomplice in this scheme, but it is more likely she isn\u2019t.\n* If Kanon is still alive, the Red Truths that **Kanon did not commit suicide** and **Kanon\u2019s death was not an accident** will be satisfied. If this is the case, then Nanjo certainly played a part in pretending that Kanon was dead.\n* The purpose of the Letter in Kinzo\u2019s study is probably to ensure that some of those people who\u2019re present in the study would be forced to go outside. This is because the study is perfectly safe from outside interference. Anyone in a similar situation would think that the murderer would be among them in the study, and that was probably the case. However, the one who placed the letter would probably be a mere accomplice, most likely.\n* It is stated in Red that **Maria did not kill Genji, Kumasawa and Nanjo**, and that **Genji, Nanjo and Kumasawa were not killers**. Due to **Knox\u2019s 10th**, we can say for sure that Genji, Kumasawa and Nanjo are most certainly dead. Thus, Kanon, whose dead or alive status is not stated in Red, is the only one who could have killed Genji and the rest.\n* Another interesting fact to look at is the concept of an accomplice. They certainly take part in an offence (here, murder), but it is impossible to say that they commit the murder themselves. Thus, unless there is more than one killer, the accomplice cannot be the killer, and the killer cannot be an accomplice. This concept can immediately twist the Red Truth that **Genji, Kumasawa and Nanjo are not Killers**, since there is no Red Truth which states that *Genji, Nanjo and Kumasawa are not Accomplices*.\n* Since **Natsuhi did not commit Suicide**, according to one of the Red Truths, and that **someone actually pointed a gun towards her forehead and shot her** (according to another Red Truth), then Kanon is the only person who could do so.\n* Of course, since Battler is the Detective here (the person through which the readers interact with the story), according to **Knox\u2019s 7th**, Battler is most certainly not the culprit.\n\nThus, according to the reasoning that brought me here, the culprit for the 1st game is Kanon. But the number of his accomplices is uncertain. Nanjo is definitely one of them, and I think that Maria is too, either knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "title":"Questions Arcs Finished, Theories and Questions Aplenty",
        "selftext":"I'm finally done with the Questions Arcs, and boy has it been a ride! Before I begin, PLEASE DON'T SPOIL ME! NO SPOILERS PLEASE!\n\nWith that outta the way, here are my thoughts on Episode 4 (with flashbacks to the previous Episodes):\n\n**Why is Beatrice so obsessed with Battler?**\n\nEver since the beginning of this story, this question has always been on my mind. Sure, Battler is a stellar idiot (but still one of my favorite characters), but I still don't feel like there's enough of a reason (so far) for Beatrice to focus on Battler accepting who she is so much. To me, her obsession seems eerily similar to Kinzo's obsession for her.\n\nSo far, everyone (except Maria, Ange and the servants) has a similar determination and grit, as well as the anti-magic toxin (supposedly), especially Kyrie and George, so why not them? What makes Battler so important to the Golden Witch? Why is he, and only he, the only one who can have a match with the Witch as equals?\n\n**Ushiromiya Kinzo has been dead since the beginning for each game so far?!**\n\nThat was honestly a curveball I didn't expect, and a significant one at that. But in all honesty, I really should have seen it coming. Umineko operates on the premise that *Nothing is as it seems.* And I don't think the rest of the family has ever seen Kinzo in person other than in Episode 4. Or someone that's inherited his name and seems like him, I guess.\n\nSo that thankfully opens up a few options of possible culprits. But I guess that it's a good rule of thumb to remember that *A whole lot of the story's intrigue surrounds this man.* So I guess you can say that Kinzo still has a very important role to play in the Answers Arcs.\n\n**Who or what in the world are the Ushiromiya family's servants?**\n\nNow that Kinzo's been confirmed as deceased, just what the hell do these servants do in the Family Head's Room? I really cannot believe that Genji, Shannon, Kanon and the rest have no part in the murders so far. I feel that they probably already know who the killer is (if it's not one or all of them), and are indirectly assisting him\/her in carrying out the murders.\n\n**The mystery of who the Kanon, whom those in the Servants' Quarters saw, was.**\n\nSince Lambdadelta denied Battler's theory that someone had inherited Kanon's name, just who in the world was that Kanon? Since I don't remember the red truths that Beato fired during Episode 2 regarding this, I'm just going to put forward my two cents here. If we go forward with the 'Servants are accomplices' theory, then either Kanon was dead the first time he was discovered, or he wasn't. Either way, all the dudes in the Servants' Quarters had to do was bring him into the room, to satisfy Beato's red truth. But I don't have a clue as to what exactly happened after all that.\n\n**The mystery of Person 'X'.**\n\nThis, in my opinion, would be the worst way Umineko could end. Some person we haven't known from the beginning, as the culprit? Not that much of a surprise, or a twist. A boring way to end such an amazing story.\n\nX would truly take out all the intrigue, mystery, pain and beauty from Umineko, so, going with my gut, I'm claiming that the *True killer, if there is an X, will not be X.*\n\n**Battler's Sin.**\n\nFrom what I can tell, Beato definitely has something to do with Battler's sin. At this point, I don't really understand whether *the nature of Battler's sin is what Beato is truly concerned about, or that he had forgotten it, or perhaps both?*\n\nI guess it's too soon to tell.\n\n**Nanjo is now shady as hell.**\n\nWith Kinzo dead, why in the world is Nanjo even on Rokkenjima for the annual conference? It seems obvious that he's also taking part in some sort of ploy that only he and the family's servants know about, but is it directly related to the murders, or is it something else entirely?\n\n**Just what does Maria know?**\n\nIn my opinion, Maria, is one of the most intriguing characters in Umineko, excluding Beatrice and Kinzo. As seen in Episode 4, she shows no hesitation to repeatedly kill her mom in the most gruesome ways she can think of. Right now, I'm convinced that she probably has either dual or multiple personalities, just to deal with the shock and hurt her mother dished out, which is ironic, since she believes that her mother is the one with that problem.\n\nMaria probably will be the key to solving the mystery of who Beatrice really is.\n\n**Could Battler possibly be the culprit?**\n\nI know that I'm really stretching possibilities here, but is it inconceivable that Battler might be the True Killer? I know that everything that has happened so far, almost completely denies this, and I'm not basing this on anything I've found so far in Episodes 1-4.\n\nI just thought of the most shocking, and perhaps most fitting way Umineko could end, and I arrived at this conclusion. If this was indeed the absolute truth, it would be the most devastating, philosophical, and yet fitting way for Umineko to end. After all, *Nothing is as it seems on Rokkenjima, right?*\n\n**The mystery of who the Golden Witch, Beatrice, really is.**\n\nI guess you can call it the pivotal point of this novel. *In the end, who in the world is Beatrice?*\n\nIs she a *human, or perhaps an illusion?*\n\n*A collective fabrication of many minds, or an actual person?*\n\nAs of now, I don't have any answer to this question, but I always think of the phrase, \"*Without Love, it cannot be 'seen'\",* that seems to be the central message of Umineko.\n\nDoes the answer to the mystery of who exactly the enigma Beatrice is, lie in this phrase?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I mentioned in the title, these are just my thoughts on everything that's happened so far in the VN.\n\nWhat are your opinions on these theories? If there are any errors in my theories, please do let me know.",

But the things is there aren't CGs in the Pachinko, and usually I just found the CGs on the wiki afterwards so I didn't miss them. My question is though if it would be recommended to download the 07th-mod for the final episode? Since I hear a lot of people loving the CGs from that episode?",

Despite the initially bleak setting of a closed murder, the novel is very hopeful with urging readers to exercise compassion and understanding why people do certain things before labeling them as something. (without love it cannot be seen) \n\nI also liked the message of not using truths to hurt and to let people have their own truths. It really showed the cruelty that people exercise in the name of brutal honesty (ERIKA) as just being brutality with the excuse of honesty. \n\nAnd Sayo\u2019s situation. Their dysphoria and using mysteries as a way to communicate and try to connect really resonated.\n\nI truly feel changed and like I have grown after this.",

I waited until all of the Amazon listings went away, but feel free to remove this if you want to.\n\nAnyway, here's the entire dai\/M.Graveyard sheet music book. I know a lot of people have wanted this, but, like mentioned above, it was technically available on Amazon for the cheap price of $250. But with that gone, I've gone ahead and scanned and uploaded it. I really only waited that long because it was a pain to scan all \\~111 pages on a flat scanner, and while I worked out how to best scan it, a few pages in the beginning got some messy spots in them. Past that, though, the quality is perfectly fine, and all of the pages are plenty readable. \n\nBecause so many people have wanted this, and it's so hard to find, I'm not saying you should spread it around to as many people as possible to show everyone the amazing music of dai. But they'd probably be happy if they somehow could get these sheets, so do what you want.  Anyway, I hope the people who wanted this are happy now :)\n\nIf the links stop working, just message me for the sheets, and the PDF is just all of the pages, but in a single file.\n\n \n\nSongs (in order, some are from Higurashi):\n\n1. being\n2. dir\n3. \u751f\u307e\u308c\u3066\u304d\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3066\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046 (Thanks for Being Born) (piano solo\/accompanist arrangement)\n4.

        "title":"I just finished episode 5, and I have a theory about the real culprit and some other stuff...",
        "selftext":"So, I just finished the ????? of episode 5, and I'm definitely hyped for episode 6.\n\nDuring this episode we heard Rudolf telling Battler that he has something to discuss about Battlers birth and that he might die during this trip. This got me thinking about stuff I had already thought of during the earlier episodes.\n\nFirst of, I think I'm pretty sure that Battler is Kyries son. This is because if you look at Ange and Battler side by side, you can see that they look really similar (Same eye and hair color, and they look all around like biological siblings). And other thing that supports my theory is the fact that Battler isn't Asumus son, but he is still Rudolfs son (+ We learned that Rudolf always cared for Battler and wanted to be a part of Battlers life).\n\nBut if Battler actually is Kyries son, this creates quite a contradiction since Kyrie claims that she lost her son to a miscarriage during her fight with Leviathan in episode 3. I thought that why would Kyrie lie like that. But that contradiction made me think of a theory where both Kyrie and Rudolf would be one of the culprits of the game.\n\nI originally thought that the culprit of the murders is a single entity (Either a single person or multiple people in a group), but then I realized that all of the suspects I thought up had also had their close ones killed (Namely Eva, who has had her husband and son killed multiple times). So I reasoned that there must be multiple entities killing people.\n\nSo my theory is that Kyrie and Rudolf are working together to wipe out the ushiromiya family. I think that Battlers sin that he commited six years ago is that he told someone\/did something that kickstarted the plan for Kyrie and Rudolf to wipe out the Ushiromiyas. I don't what it was, but I think it is something related to Asumu. After Battler left, they couldn't find an opportunity to act out their plan since Ange was always with them, so when Ange became sick before the conference, it was their lucky opportunity. Unfortunately this year Battler decided to come with them, which threw a wrench in their plan. They decided to still carry out the murders, but they wanted to leave Battler unscathed (This would explain why Battler almost always survives until the end of the game).\n\nI could think of a couple different meanings for Rudolf to say that he might die. First, he suspects that someone has caught wind of their plans, and tries to stop them. Or then Rudolf is signaling to Kyrie that they are going to be the \"first victims\" in episode 1 (If I remember correctly, both Rudolf and Kyries faces were unrecognizable, which leaves room for body doubles).\n\nFor my claim that here are multiple entities killing people, there is episode 3 where It's pretty much confirmed that Eva was at least partly the killer. My theory is that after Hideyoshi and George died, she flipped and decided to kill the rest of the group.\n\nOther than that, I unfortunately cannot think of ways how Kyrie and Rudolf could have carried out the murders. Maybe they could have strangled Krauss and Natsuhi in episode 3, but the fact that they were very dead when the police arrived kind breaks this possibility. All and all this theory isn't really strong when it comes to the murders, but I think I have managed to create some kind of reason for why this all happened.\n\nWell, this is just a theory. If there is (which I'm sure there is) some contradictions or other things I missed in previous episodes, let me know! Umineko has definitely been great this far, and I cannot wait for what the 3 last episodes will bring!",

        "selftext":"Title. Explanation is that the game Path of Exile has purchasable supporter packs that allow you to add an existing item with a custom foil to a mystery box key that drops in game that will announce the text you submit when the item you chose drops. [Here's a link for more information](https:\/\/www.pathofexile.com\/forum\/view-thread\/3333825). I still have to submit mine and want it to be an allusion to Umineko. \n\nThe item I'm most likely choosing is [Paradoxica](https:\/\/www.poewiki.net\/wiki\/Paradoxica) with a gold foil since I believe an item that references reflections and unveiling hidden mods is the most thematically Umineko unique item I could think of (though if you play I'll take suggestions), but I need something to include as the drop text and just using \"Without love it cannot be seen\" is a little too short and confusing to people not familiar with Umineko to use outright.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a direct quote, in fact it probably shouldn't be. I've tried looking up \"Umineko quotes\" and every one I've seen wouldn't make sense without context or outside of a conversation, so I'm mainly asking for ideas for a blurb that gets the meaning of Umineko across without being too direct. My working attempt is something like \"There are as many truths as there are people. The pessimist trusts only the truth in the mirror, the optimist believes that without love the truth cannot be seen.\" But I'm not too confident with it, so I'd like to see what you can think up. Whatever I think is best would be added to the game pending dev approval",

But as I started to age, my mom would give me \"age appropriate\" (like not graphic murders) books, and even to this day she'll hand me a murder mystery thriller she just read, and I'll do the same.\n\nSo as someone who has been reading the genre for as long as I can remember, I can feel a good, deep connection with Umineko. Especially with a certain few characters who know the genre well.\n\nI really do appreciate how much this VN captures the love and crictism readers have with the murder mystery genre.",

It's my first time writing in this subreddit, but I have been a fan of Umineko for a bit over a year now.\n\nDuring this year, I tried to convince several of my friends to read it, but I experienced a lot of issues: the visual novel format is unfamiliar to most (I had never read a VN before Umineko), reading on a computer screen is unappealing, and the huge time investment is discouraging.\n\nWorking with a friend that was similarly impressed by Umineko, we created Kindle (.mobi) and Kobo (.epub) files for all the Episodes, starting from [this Let's Play from Professor Prof](https:\/\/lparchive.org\/Umineko-no-Naku-Koro-ni\/), that transcribed most of the text and used lots of screenshots. If you are interested in the details, we coded some scripts to convert the HTML of the Let's Play website to the format used for e-readers.\n\nWe now finalized a first version, and I'd need someone's help to double-check that everything looks good.\n\nHere is a link to a Google Drive with the files for all the Episodes (.mobi for Kindle, .epub for Kobo): [https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1ymhIO\\_qa2qhNds\\_1YYccJVSKLNBs4-yZ?usp=share\\_link](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1ymhIO_qa2qhNds_1YYccJVSKLNBs4-yZ?usp=share_link)\n\nWhat I am mostly interested in checking is:\n\n* readability; some parts might not be readable\n* font\/formatting consistency; I tried to use some special formatting for the Red and Blue Truth, that should be coherent everywhere\n* any other advice to make it more enjoyable\n\nIf you are willing to help me, send any correction you think should be added to the text at umineko AT tutanota DOT com\n\nYou are also of course very welcome to use the files to try and convert your friends.

        "title":"Thoughts after finishing episode 6",
        "selftext":"Before I go any further into this, I should probably put a disclaimer that I had to take 2 big breaks in the middle of this episode and it may affect how I viewed it. If you want to see my thoughts as I was reading it, I took the time to note down some of the ideas that were coming to my mind in a google doc linked below.  \n\n\nThis episode felt like the biggest changeup pace-wise since we were introduced to the meta-world in the episode 1 tea party. It felt slower than any of the prior episodes, more of a suffocating tone was induced into it, likely to simulate the chain situation if I were to guess. The slower pace isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I disliked how it was transformed into the climax at the wedding with the action scenes. The action scenes felt entirely detrimental to me, failing at both enhancing the characters and advancing the duels of mystery and witchcraft. The music in this episode also felt more anemic than some of the prior episodes, but we have been spoiled by some amazing tracks in episode 5. That all being said, I would rank it in the middle of the episodes so far ( 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 4 &gt; 1). Why would I rank it there? Well, let's get into what I did like about the episode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy favorite bit of the episode was without a doubt, the George-Eva fight. This was how I want the action scenes to play out ideally. The scene beautifully served to highlight the oppressive nature of Eva's parenting to George and his eventual rebellion to pursue his own interest. Furthermore, it smoothly highlights the contradictions between Eva's parenting style and her own anger at the treatment given to her by Kinzo. Showcasing how the scars of Kinzo's parenting continue to haunt through the generations, even if Eva thinks herself above his flaws.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKyrie is a psycho. Nothing more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe love game from Furfur and Zepar is perhaps the largest indication of the Kannon = Shannon = Beatrice logic for anybody who hasn't gotten it by this point. It's almost a slap in the face how blatant they are about the whole thing. With the whole conversation about why they can't just let the lover pairs be, and the whole fight needing to happen no matter what  (and they even had Kannon and Shannon alone fight it out lol).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy favorite logic fight of the episode definitely has to be the cup trick between Maria and Erika in the beginning. There has been no clearer showcase of the core premises of the novel so far. On one side we have Maria's magic symbolizing the enjoyment resulting from a willful suspension of belief. On the other hand, comes Erika's cold truth that serves only to present tear apart a person's happiness for no reason except that it is the truth. Magic throughout the series so far has been an escape for anybody to derive their happiness from harsh realities, from Sakutorou, being the companion Maria needed in   \nplace of her mother, in episode 4 to Ange's stakes being the friends she never had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo touch on the chain fight, it is probably one of the weaker traps showcased so far. Anybody who knew about the Kshannontrice logic would easily know the solution after the logic of Battler being saved is revealed, at the very minimum. Another possibility not entertained by the novel was that somebody had faked being Battler's corpse, but I much prefer to the Kshannontrice theory as it is much more consistent with how the rest of the novel acts, even if it makes an easier solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe conclusion to this episode is probably my 2nd favorite behind episode 5 because while the closing challenge is significantly less hard than the red web of truths, the reunion of lively Beato and Battler made such an enjoyable moment that it well overtook episode the ending of episode 3 overall. I hope the Ushiromiyas enjoy their rest in the golden land before Bernkastel turns the wheel once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf the challenges that I specified that I wanted to tackle after finishing episode 4, the only one that still manages to befuddle me is why the servants and Nanjo are concealing the matter of Kshannon. My original assumption was that they felt like they had parental roles in relation to them and wanted to protect Kshannon. This theory was supported a little bit by Kannon mentioning how Kumasawa and Genji felt like parents to them in the saving Battler scene, but I don't consider that to be enough evidence alone. It doesn't really explain why Nanjo didn't out Kshannon, but maybe he simply doesn't know the whole truth.\n\nThe matter of Battler's heritage feels pretty dry at this point with no real leading theory introduced this episode. I'm currently entertaining a theory of Battler simply being adopted (or a child of one of Rudolph's flings) and Asumu miscarried originally. It definitely feels wrong, but its the best line of thought I got going for me right now. Even if I'm wrong, I have a feeling that Bernkastel's gameboard will definitely have this as a core tenet of the game with the talk of revenge, so I look to forward to how this progresses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes for Episode 6: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1bATBaGWkM8EyHdbjgWNWNdKvq9eFTmO2rKRikvLW4pU\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1bATBaGWkM8EyHdbjgWNWNdKvq9eFTmO2rKRikvLW4pU\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nMy overview for episode 5:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/umineko\/comments\/ukixjg\/comment\/i7uv777\/?context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/umineko\/comments\/ukixjg\/comment\/i7uv777\/?context=3)",

Did Kinzo ever tell Sayo how he met Beatrice, and what we saw is simply her interpretation of events. If so, can we count the flashback as unreliable narration?
