The cast is so damn memorable and well written.    \nBest moments for me would be confession of the golden witch and the drowning scene.    \n\nMade a post about my theory after ep 4 and it turned out right lol, was really happy.   \n\nSomethings which still haven't resolved in me are follows though:    \n- how is someone supposed to understand the whydunnit by just ep 1-4? Yet will said he figured it out by then, i just can't see enough hints to make that conclusion from ep 1-4 only even now.   \n- please clear me on this, battler in the drowning scene is the real one, but i don't see why he would throw his life for shannon, according to the manga, he noticed that beato is shannon yet he jumped for a girl he hasn't seen in 6 years? He threw away his life for that girl to whom he had a crush on at the age of 12 even though his sister was waiting for him? \nIf we go by the vn, it appears both are the battler and beato which we followed in the story, then it would make sense because he really really loves her. \nBut according to the manga, that beato is just her childhood crush to whom he didn't talk to from ages.    \n\n\nAs for the ep ranking:    \n8&gt;7&gt;6&gt;4&gt;5&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1   \nEp 2 felt much much better once i completed it lol.    \nTier list is also attached, i just can't put beato shannon and kanon is separate tiers man, it kinda breaks my heart.",

Opponents can refute it with counterarguments (2bar) to prevent the super. The instigator can then counter proclaim (2bar), succeeding metaworld with reduced metaworld duration. This can occur one more time back and forth\n\nBasically every character has 1x proclamation, 2x sequential counter proclamation and 2x sequential counter arguments. Would love to see a video showcasing these for every character, using char specific pairings (eg battler v beato, shannon v George, Kanon v jessica etc).\n\nAnyone come across anything like this? Or a video like this would b really neat",

That's what my first love was like, ihihi.\"\n\nUnless I have missed something, Battler is more than likely talking about his relationship with Sayo here. Either way, it's also a perfect description of the relationship Jessica had with Yoshiya.\n\nOther thing that made me think this is the second twilight of the second game. Yoshiya doesn't read the room correctly, and ends up making a comment that's meant to be nice but ends up destroying Jessica's hopes and dreams. Which is a very similar situation to the one Sayo had with Battler and his false promise. \n\nBeatrice herself later shows up to tell Yoshiya exactly that, and she finds the sin so bad to the point it motivates her to kill Yoshiya and Jessica. The entire twilight was probably a hint directed towards Battler, but because of how Beatrice's game works it's also something Yoshiya would have done in character.\n\nBesides being a cool parallel, it does make me wonder what does this mean from Sayo's perspective. Yoshiya's shy and reserved attitude on the relationship is mostly blamed on his furniture complex, but now that we know he already experienced such a similar relationship while being on Jessica's position, it does make me wonder if he was aware of the irony of the entire situation.\n\nWas it on purpose? Was it on accident? Was it subconscious? Can't really think of any concrete theory at the moment. What do you guys think?",

This was a pretty annoying rut as both had points against them. The main reason   I went with George was because of his purple statement:  \n  \n**\"no one could kill Doctor Nanjo inside the guesthouse\"**  \n  \ndirectly went against the narrative that states:  \n  \n**\"He [Doctor Nanjo] was killed in the entrance hall of the guesthouse\"**.  \n  \nOf course, this would go against Maria's purple, stating that George could only kill \"kids\"; there were no scenarios were both he and Maria could be culprits (so I had to assume that somehow Kanon was a separate person in this game, which was frustrating).  \n  \nIs there an actual solution to this that I am missing?

        "selftext":"Hi. New to Umineko, I've heard amazing things about this game. I'm not a smart person, but I try to be very analytical and I love media, so script quality matters immensely to me. Especially for such an allegedly thematically intricate story, I want to be able to be not only immersed and invested but constantly think about what the words could mean and get the best meaning and style possible out of the experience. So I'm asking advice especially from people who have a great grasp of Umineko's nuances even if small, and hopefully those who have a great grasp of what both TLs are like. What's the best TL? I've been hearing it's UmiPro's, but I want to be sure for my first time. (Who knows if I'll like it enough to play it again)\n\nThis is also instrumental to my mod choice, because I'm willing to give up the very endearing original sprites 07th allows for the sake of a superior TL. I'm aware I can put the WH TL into UmiPro, but AFAIK it's not the MG TL, correct? Which is an improved version of the OG WH TL.",

All I'll say is that Battler Ushiromiya is my favorite character of all time and I don't think there was a better way to conclude his character than with that twist!\n\nBattler being in love with Beatrice, there being more than one Beatrice, and that Natsuhi was the person who basically caused all of Umineko's events to set in motion are some of the other standout twists for me!\n\nEDIT: OH SHIT I FORGOT ABOUT THE EPISODE 7 TEA PARTY!
